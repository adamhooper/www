<p>These are all pictures I took while in Gulu. I did not take many more: I feel it's in bad taste to act like a tourist in Gulu. Mostly, I took pictures when nobody was looking.</p>
<p>The Internet is slower than a matatu in Kampala rush hour traffic, but since I'm heading to Bwindi tomorrow (to see the gorillas) now is an appropriate time for me to clean out my camera. Excuse the small-ness of these images: accost me upon my return to Canada, and I can show larger, non-cropped versions. (If I'm lucky, I'll be able to bring back video footage as well....)</p>

<p>I have changed my website's colour scheme. Which just goes to show how exciting I am. It also illustrates graphically exactly how much you're missing if you just vacuum up my blog with a fancy reader program. And that hints at the age-old dilemma: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to visit a friend's website every day and hit the Refresh button, or to end the madness with a blog reader program.</p>

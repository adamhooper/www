<p>As I was interviewing a refugee in a camp about his inspiring story, an outsider came to make sure I was telling it properly.</p>
<p>"You're getting how wretched people are here, right?" he asked.</p>

<p>The outsider, who is not a refugee, would benefit politically if I wrote a story about wretchedness. He'd hold my story up high, proclaiming, "look! even a Westerner wrote that these people are wretched!" and if that helped him achieve his ends ... he'd get richer.</p>
<p>As a journalist, there's nothing I hate more than an interview with an agenda. I can trace it back to my first "real" interview for my first story assignment at school in Ottawa: my very first character told me, "you <em>have</em> to write X."</p>
<p>To keep the conversation going, I bit my tongue over my retort: "actually, I don't. I'm not writing this for you."</p>

<p>In East Africa, most journalists <em>are</em> writing for their subjects. Reporters here expect free food, transport, gifts and even cash from people with vested interests. The outsider at the refugee camp assumed I had been paid to write the story his way. (I had turned down the money.)</p>
<p>My refugee was different. He wasn't worried about looking rich or poor, confident or concerned, lucky or stoic. He told me the easy and tricky aspects of his life because, well, I asked.</p>
<p>As a journalist, there's nothing I love more than agenda-free honesty. I stayed up all night writing his story.</p>

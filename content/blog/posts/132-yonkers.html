<p>What does gambling mean to you?</p>
<p>To me, gambling is a lark. Last night I won sixty cents on a horse
named <q>Pacific Flora:</q> my tactic was to select the horse with the
slowest-sounding name, and after searching the big book of small
numbers in vain for a name along the lines of <q>Bro-Can Leg,</q> I
decided seafaring algae might be comically slow as well. Pacific
Flora somehow managed to evolve its way to first place.</p>
<p>Then I saw the slot machines.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><q>Insert $1 to $100.</q></p>
<p>I inserted $1; I pushed a button a few times; I eventually lost
every penny; and I went to a different machine.</p>
<p>I inserted $1; I pushed a button a few times. This time, I did not
even bother looking at the screen. I already knew how the story would
end, and the flashing lights and electronic sounds were distracting
me from a conversation I was having. Sure enough, after pushing the
button a few times, the machine diplomatically encouraged me to pay
up or leave, refusing to illuminate its <q>bet</q> button.</p>

<p>Bored, I decided to walk around.</p>
<p>But I could not walk: I could only swim in a sea of slot machines.
I came to realize I had been gambling at the fringe of a venture
5,000 machines across. As I delved deeper into the building I lost
sight of all landmarks: only row after row of blinking lights and
losing betters greeted my eyes, stretching to infinityâ€”a financial
infinity for those shrewd enough to design it.</p>
<p>I got lost.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Twice.</p>
<p>Ordinary people devise systems to beat these machines:
simultaneous bets, fluctuating antes, and strict, superstitious
mathematical formulas, hopelessly created to compete with
mathematical formulas which (and you would think committed gamblers
would pause to consider this at <i>some</i> point) are invariably
designed by smarter, more educated, wealthier people who themselves
do not bet with their creations.</p>
<p>At the corner of the complex, adjacent to the exit, sits a small,
underused row of counters labeled <q>REDEMPTION.</q> It lent a
biblical tone to the evening: with deliverance so convenient and
well-advertised, evidence suggests the vast majority would prefer to
sacrifice money, time, and sometimes souls to mechanized thieves and
their devious designers.</p>

<p>What does gambling mean to me? In this instance, it means the
aggregation of poor people's money in rich people's pockets.</p>
<p>But I am still missing a sense of scale. In the coming year,
Yonkers Raceway will triple its number of machines, effectively
tripling its ability to accept $1 to $100.</p>

<p>Even more stuff about McGill's network that I hate! <a href="http://www.webct.com">WebCT</a> (<em>the worst</em> classroom management web system thingy) at McGill has a really stupid sign-in page. I used to be able to bookmark the login page and enter by pressing Enter; but when they <q>upgraded</q> to <q>WebCT Vista</q> they removed that feature.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="http://www.adamhooper.com:4242/my_code/code/random/webct-auto-login.user.js">Greasemonkey script</a> which automatically clicks the <q>Submit</q> button on the sign-in page. It assumes your password is auto-completed.</p>
<p>It eliminates one of those little things that makes life just a teeny bit worse.</p>

<p>I've only tested it with <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/extensions">the Epiphany Greasemonkey extension</a> but I expect it works with Firefox as well.</p>

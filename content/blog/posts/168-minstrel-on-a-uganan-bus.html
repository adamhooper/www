<p>Julius, Carleton University's Rwandan superhero, invited me to visit his family in Uganda.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/rw-kagitumba-border-to-uganda.jpg" alt="" /><br />Crossing from Rwanda into Uganda, the road becomes unpaved and the border officials and bus ticket vendors happily try and scam you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-mirama-hills-pineapple-bicycle.jpg" alt="" /><br />The pineapples become tastier, too.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-murami-banana-skyline.jpg" alt="" /><br />Bananas spring up <em>everywhere</em>. Even Rwandans agree the matoke (mashed banana, Uganda's staple food) carries more flavour on this side of the border.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-murami-cow.jpg" alt="" /><br />On Julius's property, right near the Rwandan border, there are beautiful cows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-murami-fishing-nets.jpg" alt="" /><br />Villagers set up nets to trap fishes in the rainy season. Now that the season is over, the water level has dropped and the nets aren't even submerged.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-murami-milking.jpg" alt="" /><br />Cows still provide ample nutritious beverage and a small income.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-murami-julius-and-his-family.jpg" alt="" /><br />Julius, the city slicker, hadn't visited his family in a year; they couldn't get enough of him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-murami-sunset-chez-julius.jpg" alt="" /><br />The day came to an end...</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-murami-dawn-chez-julius.jpg" alt="" /><br />...and a new one began.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-murami-banana-transport.jpg" alt="" /><br />After a 45-minute walk and 15-minute motorcycle ride, we arrived at the nearest trading hub. We waited for a bus instead of mounting this popular banana transport.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-mbarara-skyline.jpg" alt="" /><br />We spent a night in the Ugandan city of Mbarara.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ug-murami-minstrel.jpg" alt="" /><br />On our bus back to Kigali (which, in Ugandan fashion, cost more than the going rate and took about twice the time and effort we were promised), a wandering minstrel sang us tunes.</p>
<p>I'd forgotten how different Uganda is from Rwanda. Food is cheaper and more plentiful; rules are more lax; and timing is more liberal. I wish I had the time to spend a few months there before my return to Canada in August.</p>

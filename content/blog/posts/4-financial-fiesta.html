<p>Little financial bonuses:</p>
<ul>
 <li>My new VISA card has a different statement due date. That means I've got a huge balance riding on it for several months at 0% interest. Sweet.</li>
 <li>$1US = $1.13CAN. I wonder if the exchange rate has ever been lower in my lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked for an apartment today. My lack of United States credit history and my short lease terms are obstacles. I saw one place which looks nice, but it made me worry about my budget. I also looked at the NASA Ames Research Centre, which is cheaper than anything else I could find. At this point I'm leaning towards Ames: it's simply less hassle. I haven't decided whether I'd choose to room with somebody or not. The lack of Internet is a big minus.</p>

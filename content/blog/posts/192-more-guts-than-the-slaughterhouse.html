<p>Hope, B.C. reminded me of Kahama, Tanzania. My first thought as I rolled in was, “this must have been a gold-rush town.”</p>
<p>I was half-right. The B.C. gold rush developed the trading town, a decade after the Hudson Bay Company erected a fur-trade fort there in 1848.</p>
<p>It has the same feel as Kahama. Motels and hotels abound, many with “nice clean rooms,” as advertised by the changeable sign letters competing for your business. It's a gateway town: to the west, you'll find the once gold-rich Fraser River and eventually Vancouver; to the north and east, three highways attack the mountains: the Trans-Canada, the Crow's Nest and the Yellowhead.</p>

<p>All three roads are wickedly steep and all three suffer from the weather—a winter drive from the coast is a game of roulette, with electronic signs at Hope telling travellers which routes are open. For all three, “carry chains beyond this point.”</p>
<p>I have a bicycle chain.</p>
<p>I decided upon the Crow's Nest highway up to Allison Pass, altitude 1,342 metres. (Hope sits at about 50 metres above sea level.)</p>

<p>I was folding my map. A kind, near-bald man walked out of a restaurant, saw my map and asked, “where d'you wanna go?”</p>
<p>I told him I was headed to Princeton, along the number three.</p>
<p>He said I could travel the entire 130 kilometres that afternoon. I laughed and said there wasn't a chance.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>He strained to think of hotels along the way, but I interrupted him. “I'm camping,” I said.</p>
<p>He looked at my bicycle, as if wondering whether a tent could fit in the panniers.</p>
<p>“You sleep outside?”</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“Yup.”</p>
<p>“You got more guts than the slaughterhouse!” he said, then he walked away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ca-bc-hope-east-of-town.jpg" alt="" /><br />This is what the end of Hope looks like.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This led me to a 20-kilometre monster climb to less than half the altitude of the pass. It took hours, and I had another 40 or so kilometres ahead. That's why they say I'm beyond Hope.</p>
<p>The wind cooled and gnawed. Something nearby creaked; I look over my shoulder. It was a road sign hung from above, scraping rust as it swayed.</p>
<p>I approached a settlement. I needed water and I figured I'd find some here. A giant billboard announced “Sunshine Valley,” each letter wrapped in its own coloured circle, with a happy family beneath. The colours had faded and some paint had peeled completely, giving the entire village the air of a carnival attraction from a horror film.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I left the highway and entered town. There was an RV site and around 20 or 30 RVs had parked there. Nobody was outside, and the office was closed.</p>
<p>As the wind bit I decided the name “Sunshine Valley” stretches the truth. The tiny collection of dirt roads lies halfway up a mountain, so it's hardly a valley. If it <em>were</em> a valley, logic dictates it wouldn't receive much sunlight. As I thought this a ray of sun pierced the rainclouds and struck me, but I felt no warmth. If this is a sunshine valley, then a propane tank and hamburger in midwinter are a barbecue party.</p>
<p>I biked further into town, past new homes with no owners.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Children played in a playground, but they weren't making any noise. They didn't look at me. There were no parents.</p>
<p>I fled.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, Wikipedia tells me Sunshine Valley was a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II.)</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Further up the Crow's Nest highway, all the campgrounds had closed for winter. I was too exhausted and it was too late for me to climb to the top, so I turned into what may have been a campground driveway, hid my bike, marched my packs through waist-deep snow and set up camp.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ca-bc-allison-pass-camp.jpg" alt="" /><br />I pitched my tent where a tree had warmed the ground enough to melt the snow. My path in was over a metre deep but if I shifted my weight carefully I could creep along the snow's crust without falling through.</p>
<p>I wasn't cold, despite the snow. I slept soundly, despite my lack of bear spray.</p>

<p>I guess I got guts.</p>

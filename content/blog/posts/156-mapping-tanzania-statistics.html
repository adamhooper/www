<p>When people talk about a developing country, they usually lump every part of that country together. But that's misleading.</p>
<p>I found a neat way to display indicators on a map of Tanzania. I tested it out with Tanzania census data and the result was so neat I figured I should publish it.</p>
<p>If you are <em>not</em> using Internet Explorer (8 or lower), check out <a href="/eng/articles/9">a map showing some of Tanzania's development indicators</a>.</p>

<p>As you can see, the level of development varies enormously depending on where in the country you are.</p>

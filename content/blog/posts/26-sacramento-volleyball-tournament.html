<p>(Wow, this is the first blog post in which I actually mention anybody from California besides myself. But I figure I can't avoid it much longer.)</p>
<p>Saturday, Vincent and I drove to Sacramento and watched the AVP beach volleyball tournament. This was my first time watching professional volleyball. The tournament hosted both men's and women's games, and we timed it so that we could watch the men's final. Afterwards, we drove to the capitol to be tourists, then we drove home. I took pictures, and later compiled my <a href="http://www.adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Sacramento%20Volleyball">photo album of Sacramento and AVP volleyball</a>.</p>
<p>The drive took about two hours. I'll keep this entry shorter by sparing the details.</p>

<p>The volleyball games were very cool. We watched two Men's games (including the final) and most of two women's games. It was great fun to watch the games, and Vincent knew a lot of the finer details of volleyball so he proved a great guide. We got lots of free stuff, documented at the end of the photo album. Of note are the <em>personalized</em> autographs from the winners of the championship.</p>
<p>The capitol was also quite cool. Outside we saw three weddings and at least three memorial monuments. The buildings were all closed, so we couldn't take any tours. I did get some pictures of their outsides, which are in the photo album.</p>
<p>When I got home I watched the end of the Edmonton-Carolina game. Mwahaha, Edmonton rocked. On to Game 7!</p>

<p>A little after that, I discovered that my sunblock <em>really</em> didn't work. I also ran into the same problem I had at the rugby game: my scalp gets burnt where my hair parts! Suffice it to say, I'm in quite a bit of pain.</p>
<p>Afterwards Mike and I biked out to a Mountain View Irish pub for a few beers. When the live DJ and enormous disco ball (yes, a <em>disco ball</em>) were in full swing we came home to rest for the long day ahead.</p>

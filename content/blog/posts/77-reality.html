<p><i>Challenge: I never wrote all I could and this is my last Challenge-inspired entry. Include five sentences I dreamed up which I had anticipated publishing (because I thought they sounded powerful and exciting) but which I never turned into blog entries.</i></p>
<p>I can buy a camera lens with as wide an angle as physically possible, but it will still be too narrow to capture reality.</p>
<p>I could argue that a wider camera lens would actually project less information. A mountain framed by a banana tree; a misplaced Habs jersey; a lopsided dala-dala; a motorcycle hanging from a tree: pictures merely project ideas, not reality. More information would obscure the ideas.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Similarly, my blog can only project narrow ideas: it cannot reflect reality. These Challenges I have been using on my blog have been helpful in reminding me of that.</p>
<p>What is reality? I will never know.</p>
<p>What is <em>my</em> reality?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>My reality is a veritable rat's nest of hare-brained ideas. I prod at random thoughts until I arrive at conclusions. Then I hack away at my conclusions until I get new, even more random thoughts. It strikes me that if there is such a thing as sanity, I want nothing to do with it. </p>
<p>In Tanzania, my business (publishing magazines about HIV, gender, and sexuality) is everybody else's business. My engineering mind was not trained for this kind of interactions. Can I say I am <q>networking</q> with interesting people if they will never be able to contact me? Should I call a child with HIV a <q>client</q>? Everybody is connected more strongly than anybody knows. Maybe we are all part of the same company: I am in the learning department while many other people are in the suffering department. And if the world is the biggest company ever, what does that tell me about upper management?</p>
<p>What is <em>your</em> reality?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Your reality is probably quite similar to mine: you eternally struggle to find your place in a world which seems to be treating you like one six-billionth of itself.</p>
<p>What is <em>their</em> reality?</p>
<p>I wager it is almost the same.</p>

<p>But if you have never left the comfort of the West, you are missing an important mindset. Poverty and disease are rampant in sub-Saharan Africa. Get-rich-quick schemes are often glorified get-other-people-poor schemes. Even the most timid mzungu learns that pushing and shoving is the only way to board a dala-dala here in Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>Personally, I do not blame Tanzanians for behaviour I can never understand. I see a potential for learning more about myself and my reality.</p>
<p>So far, I have never heard somebody's life story and thought, <q>I would certainly never act that way if I were that person.</q> Every time I hear somebody claim otherwise because of insignificant misunderstandings, I wince.</p>

<p>What is common to everybody's reality?</p>
<p>Different though different people's realities are, everybody's reality is composed of the same three universal truths: love, fear, and Bob Marley.</p>
<p>I see potential. Let's get together and be all right.</p>

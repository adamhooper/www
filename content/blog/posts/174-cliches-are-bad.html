<p>The Internet is a gold mine of information. But if you write that cliché on your web page, you dilute my "gold mine" search results.</p>
<p>A "gold mine" is a place where miners extract gold from the ground.</p>
<p>Most of Google's top <a href="http://http://www.google.com/search?q=literally">search results for "literally"</a> point to suggestions that you avoid the word, even if you mean it.</p>

<p>Everybody has the habit of writing clichés, just as everybody naturally spends more time choosing adjectives and adverbs than the nouns and verbs they adorn.</p>
<p>Need incentive to improve your style? Tell Google to email you daily search results of a cliché. I'm researching gold mines, and it's painful. I suppose I should be thankful I'm not researching <a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&pz=1&cf=all&ned=en_tz&hl=en&q=smoking+gun">gun smoke</a> or <a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&pz=1&cf=all&ned=en_tz&hl=en&q=red-handed">red hands</a>.</p>

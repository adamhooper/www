<p>When I traveled in London, I was surprised at how many people were using cell phones. I wondered if this is the apex of civilization: everybody communicating with everybody far away, ignoring everybody nearby. I assumed that poorer countries would have fewer cell phones, for the simple reason that they have less money.</p>
<p>Wrong. In Uganda, anybody who's anybody has a cell phone. I have yet to meet a Ugandan who cannot readily make a phone call: either with a personal cell phone, a friend's cell phone, or a cell phone stall. (Residents of IDP camps are a possible exception.) Ten minutes after meeting somebody, we'll be exchanging cell phone numbers.</p>
<p>I have accumulated approximately 50 friends so far, and they are all stored in my wee little cell phone.</p>

<p>All barriers to owning a cell phone can be overcome:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cost: a thrifty Ugandan can likely find a brand-new phone for UGX40,000 (below USD$25). Most will opt for more expensive phones, which cost twice that or more. That's nowhere near the cost of a television: it's more akin to the cost of two inter-city bus fares. Unless you're very poor, you can save up enough for a cell phone. (And I'll cover that little <q>unless</q> in another blog post.)</li>
 <li>Phone numbers: a phone number (that is, a SIM card), which lasts forever, costs the equivalent of USD$1.</li>
 <li>Airtime: airtime must be prepaid, at a price of approximately USD$0.15/min (depending on the carrier you're calling from). Receiving calls is free. The airtime can be bought <em>anywhere</em>: I'd guess anywhere in Kampala the size of a New York city block is home to 30-50 airtime vendors. There are airtime vendors in slums, villages, and even some IDP camps.</li>
 <li>Reception: It's <em>everywhere</em>. On my Canadian cell phone I lose reception on the highway between Montreal and Toronto; in Uganda, Buhoma (right next to Bwindi Impenetrable Forest) is the first village I've found where I lost reception. And even in Buhoma, there was a certain patch of ground which <em>was</em> connected. Heck, they have reception in the IDP camps.</li>
 <li>Advertisement: The cell phone companies practically hold a monopoly on billboards (the notable exception being USAID's pro-abstinance billboards, my opinion of which I'll save for another post). Beyond billboards, a fifth of all <em>buildings</em> throughout Uganda are painted in bright, primary colours, depending on which company got to them first:
  <ul>
   <li>Yellow: MTN: Everywhere You Go</li>
   <li>Blue: UTL (Uganda Telecom): It's All About U</li>
   <li>Red: Celtel: Making Life Better</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>I was waiting to snap a couple of pictures before I made this post, and I managed to find the perfect illustrations this weekend. Here they are:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><%= image_tag 'blog/uganda19.jpg' %><br/>The one spot in Buhoma with cell phone reception: you'll always find a couple of people there, which is why there is no grass under their feet.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><%= image_tag 'blog/uganda20.jpg' %><br/>Rolling hills in southwestern Uganda. Notice the red-and-white cell tower in the centre.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><%= image_tag 'blog/uganda21.jpg' %><br/>Buildings painted by all three phone companies in Buwama (a village about a half-hour away from Kampala).</p>
<p><b><i>Fun Fact</i></b>: According to the GSM Association, there are over three million mobile phone subscribers in Uganda; the phone penetration rate is 9%. Over 100,000 Ugandans are directly employed in the cell phone business. That's one job for every 30 cell phones.</p>

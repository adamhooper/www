<p>Late last year, I was meandering around the Upper West Side of
Manhattan, absorbing my new neighbourhood. As on most beautiful
weekends, a street was closed and festivities were afoot. Gravitating
towards the action, I was pleased to witness elated racers conquering
the New York City Marathon.</p>
<p>I had to smile and cheer at every runner trickling in. The
finishing times were likely quite bad by the time I started watching,
but these heroes had nonetheless managed to slay Goliath.</p>
<p>And I thought to myself, “that must feel amazing.”</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Back then, while I enjoyed walking around New York (perhaps the
most walkable city on Earth), I was far from athletic: the only
footwear I owned were dress shoes and loafers. Before committing
myself, I wanted to learn what it takes to run a marathon.</p>
<p>Marathon knowledge is easiest to find in books, coaches, prevous
marathon finishers, and the Internet. Naturally, I relied upon the
cheapest and most accessible of those options.</p>
<p>Learning a new topic takes time: I find the brain can only learn
so much about a topic without active participation. The only facts I
completely absorbed were:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
	<li>I would need to train for six months;</li>
	<li>I would often be seriously tempted to give up; and</li>
	<li>Yes, I was able to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I suppose that was all I needed to know: I bought a pair of shoes
and started running.</p>
<h3>Beginning Training; First Lessons</h3>
<p>Enthusiasm is an athlete's greatest blessing and most dangerous
curse. On my first day, as I did not know how far I was able to run,
I decided to run until I dropped. Jogging very slowly, I ran around
Central Park and then home: six and a half miles without pause.</p>
<p>Ah, how naïvely proud I was: I had just run a quarter of a
marathon (26.2 miles, or 42km) on my first day of training, and I
felt great! I triumphantly lopped the first two weeks off the
training schedule I had found on the Internet, which had suggested I
start with a paltry four miles until week three.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Not even one month into my training, I felt like my kneecaps would
pop off each time I stood up, and I was unable to descend staircases
without using handrails. I was forced to rest one entire week and I
only ran twice on another week; and even after all that rest, I ran
slowly and carefully, stoically enduring intense pain. While I could
hit the six-mile mark, the achievement was not worth the pain.</p>
<p>I learned that the shoes I had bought (from a mainstream athletics
store) were not right for me. I bought a new pair of shoes from a
specialty store and my “runner's knee” gradually faded. I was
struck by a mild bout of “shin splints” as I broke in my new
shoes, but that pain only cost me three days' worth of training.</p>
<p>While my enthusiasm kept my goal in sight, it had cost me. Because
I tried to bypass the first two weeks of easy but valuable training,
I had to endure severe pain and sacrifice even more training time
than I had skipped.</p>

<h3>Increasing Intensity</h3>
<p>Marathon training consists of several “short runs” and one
“long run” per week. At the time, I figured the reasons were
psychological; now I realize they are part of a cycle of building and
rebuilding one's system.</p>
<p>My short runs started at three or four miles of length and ended
at six or seven. I started with three short runs per week; I ended
with four. Each short run keeps the body in tune, reminding it to
convert food to energy and to transport oxygen to the muscles as
quickly as necessary. Short runs sessions are also an opportunity to
practice speedwork (through short or long sprints), oxygen absorption
capacity (by fast, distance running), and cross-training (usually
biking or swimming), all of which stress the body in new and
important ways; alas, through inconvenience and ignorance I missed
most of my opportunities to practice these alternate activities as I
focused strictly on ordinary running.</p>
<p>My long runs started at six miles and ended at just under
twenty-one. These runs are crucial in increasing endurance: a very
different aspect of training and one which is of vital importance
during a marathon. Long runs stress bones and joints, with the aim of
strengthening them; but most importantly, long runs teach the body
and mind to work together. There are limits to both: the body can
become injured, dehydrated, or completely devoid of easily-accessible
energy (glycogen): all potential marathon emergencies. Meanwhile,
focus is needed simply to keep going: a lapse in concentration could
slow me down significantly or prevent me from watching the road,
risking injury.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Long runs deplete the body's stored, easily-accessible energy (the
glycogen in the muscles and liver): aside from the rest needed to
repair the inevitable, minor muscle and bone damage caused by
constant pounding of pavement, it can take days simply to regain the
stores of energy expended during a long run. I spaced my two longest
runs (both over twenty miles) only five days apart, instead of the
standard six; after the second, I was so exhausted I feared I might
collapse in Central Park before I could stagger home.</p>
<p>Training is a matter of cycles: tricky short runs interspersed
with easy runs, long runs padded by short runs, intense weeks
punctuated with restful weeks. Cycles test, heal, and focus the
system, all while making each round of training a fresh experiment.
The body becomes a machine, learning how to satisfy the mind's
demands; the mind, on the other hand, learns how to challenge and
care for the body..</p>
<p>This part of my marathon experience was fascinating and rewarding
for me, and aside from my lack of speedwork and cross-training I feel
I generally did a great job. Had I trained another two weeks, I could
have learned which pace I should target during the marathon and how
best to overcome my body's natural aversion to digesting while
eating; instead, I decided to stay on schedule and learn the hard
way.</p>

<h3>The Taper</h3>
<p>Bones and joints suffer a constant beating; muscles develop
micro-tears; energy stores are constantly depleted and replenished:
training takes its toll, and none of these effects are helpful come
marathon day. Luckily, the body retains most of the benefits of
training for a month without exercise; so the two or three weeks
before a marathon are best spent recuperating rather than
intensifying training. At my peak, I was running 45 miles per week;
yet in the final three weeks of training (with two abbreviated long
runs), I probably only ran a total of 65 miles.</p>
<p>Because my runs were shorter, I started running mornings instead
of evenings. This helped set my internal alarm clock for 5:00am, the
time I would need to wake in Ottawa for the 7:00am starting horn. Of
course, a healthy lifestyle is indispensible as the body is healing:
my bedtime became 9:00pm, I cowered from friends' coughs and
sniffles, I gave up all unhealthy foods, coffee, and alcohol, and I
set my social life on pause. My abbreviated training and increased
health left me ceaselessly energetic, such that my only desire was to
run; but I followed the tapering discipline perfectly, with no
regrets.</p>
<h3>Marathon Day</h3>
<p>My training was a mixture between following experts' advice (with
discernable benefit) and throwing it aside (to my detriment);
marathon day itself, replete with energy and excitement, was no
different. Though a thousand factors could finish me before I
finished the race, I knew when I awoke from my (predictably) restless
sleep at 5:00am that I was completely ready.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At the starting line, my fellow racers fell into two categories:
past marathoners and new recruits. Experienced marathoners had one
and only one piece of advice: all I should really concentrate on is
finishing.</p>
<p>Both literally and figuratively, I was filled with more energy at
the start of the race than I have ever felt before. Since I had never
decided upon a pace and I knew most people run their marathons faster
than training runs, I figured I would be relaxed and patient and see
where that would take me.</p>
<p>I was relaxed, cheerful, and excited; I found myself effortlessly
plodding along at a pace which would end the marathon in 3:45: faster
than I had anticipated, but as I had never calculated my appropriate
pace I figured I might be okay.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A general weakness I discovered during training was my difficulty
with keeping down foods and fluids ingested while running. (Most
people, even endurance athletes, have this exact problem.) During a
marathon, water is absolutely necessary to avoid dehydration, and
food or energy drinks are necessary to defer physical exhaustion:
while training is indeed transformative, some bodily limits cannot be
erased, and marathons surpass those limits. Something went wrong
before the halfway point: due to my breakfast, the excessive heat and
sunlight, the crowds and onlookers, my faster-than-usual pace,
powdered Gatorade, or maybe just the excitement, I stopped at the
side of the road and vomited.</p>
<p>Thrice.</p>
<p>One does not train for six months, feel fantastic, and then give
up two hours later. I immediately forsook Gatorade in favour of water
and the energy gels I had thoughtfully stuck in my pocket. I
gradually waved goodbye to my 3:45 pipe dream, but overall I was
doing surprisingly well.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Near the halfway mark one of my starting companions—another
marathon virgin—ran up to me. I told my story and he told his: he
was happily following a 3:50 pace. We ran together for a bit, but I
knew I had started the race too fast and my only recourse was to let
him forge ahead of me and, in the course of several minutes,
disappear up ahead.</p>
<p>Resolve had replaced excitement, and the crowds of runners and
onlookers had thinned to small groups and lone runners such as
myself. The sun was high and ruthless, and the road, though
mercifully flat and picturesque aside the Rideau Canal, was
unnervingly unending. I happily heard whoops at the finish line
across the canal as the winners accomplished their goals around 2:15;
and I eventually fell into the deliberate, monotonous mindset I had
gained during training: the frame of mind, I learned, I should have
been holding all along.</p>
<p>I met another of my starting line companion, a veritable marathon
expert who had run the Boston marathon two months earlier. (Merely
qualifying for the Boston marathon is a stupendous achievement;
running two marathons within two months of each other, by all
accounts, borders on insane.) Her happy advice was to “just
finish.” She reminded me that finishing was, after all, the only
goal I had set for myself; and thus I learned from her that the first
marathon is nothing more than another learning experience. I
performed an in-flight inspection of my physiology and found I was in
fantastic shape, with no sore muscles, joints, or bones; though my
energy was draining, there was nothing to stop me from eventually
reaching the finish line. My companion and I drifted apart; and I
turned my mind to sticking one foot in front of another.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I had reached the three-quarters mark in under three hours, but I
knew a four-hour finish was unattainable. During a marathon, most of
an athlete's energy comes from the glycogen stored in the muscles and
liver; around this point in the race, the body has consumed its
maximum glycogen capacity. By eating energy gels and drinking energy
drinks along the way, some of this energy should be replaced; in my
case, depressingly, several hundred calories were lying in a pool of
vomit ten miles away. I was now extremely careful about eating and
drinking, so there was no way for me to ingest significant amounts of
energy. My body's only option was to start burning fat: a much slower
process, and one which cannot sustain a running pace. I had hit “the
wall.”</p>
<p>I had hit the wall during my final long runs, and I knew what to
expect. I simply had to slow my pace: as my last droplets of glycogen
disappeared, I slowed by 30%, stopping to walk two or three times per
mile. This section of the course was rather uninteresting, so I
whiled the time away by trying to calculate and recalculate my
expected final pace. My brain was playing tricks on me, but three
times I calculated I could hit 4:15 and only once did I calculate
4:30, so I figured I had a shot at 4:15. (An exhausted runner's mind
is rather comical.)</p>
<p>My pace was slow and steady: I suppose I had “beaten” the
wall, in that I had adjusted to my body's limitations and had
mentally and physically reduced the damage to my final time. Though
all my training math had been in miles, I was extremely happy that
the race was demarcated in kilometres: each marker was a source of
motivation, and the smaller distances helped me keep a more accurate
pace.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Ottawa, I learned, the half-marathon starts two hours later
than the marathon, and both groups of runners run the same final
stretch to the finish line. We few, proud marathoners found our paths
were criss-crossed with those of countless cheerful, 2:15
half-marathoners. I was bitter about weaving through crowds to get
water at refueling stations and having to check my blind spots before
taking walking breaks; but I was also happy to have so many people
running alongside me.</p>
<p>About a mile from the end, the 4:15 “pace bunny” (well-marked
volunteer running at a set pace) passed me: the final stretch of my
mind game had begun. I ran up to him and made sure he noticed me and
thereby motivated me; and even though my pace had been slower, I put
mind above matter and pushed my limit. Finally, there were signposts
at every hundred metres and the road dipped into a sea of ecstatic
spectators, clappers, thunder sticks, whistles, smiles, and cheers:
energy entered from all sides as I passed the pace bunny, my family,
my friends, and, finally, with my arms and smile aimed heavenwards,
the glorious finish line.</p>
<p>I had finished in 4:14.</p>

<p>My first thought was, “this feels amazing.”</p>
<p>And my second thought was, “I bet a second marathon feels
amazing, too.”</p>

<p><i>Challenge: write 1 word for each 1000 Tanzanian shillings I earn in a month. (CAN$1 is approximately 1200 Tsh.)</i></p>
<p>While talking with a local in Sipi, Uganda, I realized that he is wealthier than I am.</p>
<p>My student loan was at its zenith. The money I brought to Uganda was dwindling. I remember hoping to be thrifty enough to arrive home with $0. I succeeded.</p>

<p>Instead of paying off my debts and securing my future, I decided to keep on with my downward financial trend. I now have far less than $0.</p>
<p>Tanzanians do not believe this. White people have money, right?</p>
<p>I am solidly in debt. I have no co-signers. I have nearly no worldly possessions (by Western standards). My bank accounts are empty. I have no long-term employment. My expenditures exceed my income. Yet with my credit line, credit cards, loans, and contacts, I can easily gather $20,000 cash within minutes.</p>

<p>How did I achieve that $20,000 potential? I was born into a club: a worldwide network of mathematics which statistically rewards trustworthiness and punishes misbehaviour.</p>
<p>Bank machines exist in Tanzania. They give me money I do not have while serving luckier Tanzanians money they worked hard to earn. Credit cards exist here, too; but Tanzanians cannot get them. And my credit card has a lower interest rate than Tanzanian bank loans.</p>
<p>If I spent that $20,000 and declared bankruptcy, I would not be poor.</p>

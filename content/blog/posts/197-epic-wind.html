<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/blog/ca-sk-moosomin-sunset.jpg" alt="" /><br />The sun sets by a wind power generator near Moosomin, Saskatchewan.</p>

<p>A tale told each May on cold Prairie days<br />
Is worthy of space on my site.<br />
It's Bicycle rolling down well-ridden roads<br />
And Wind coming, asking to fight.</p>

<p>The rider crouched down, with not half a frown,<br />
Requesting the wind to abate.<br />
“I'm too oft due east,” shot Wind, shunning peace,<br />
“This year you'll be trapped and made late.”

<p>The ducks flapping east soon flapped without cease;<br />
Wind's gusts spun them 'round with a breeze.<br />
The waves grew white teeth in ditches beneath,<br />
And cans cartwheeled west just to tease.</p>

<p>As days carried on, the cyclist was worn,<br />
But Bicycle would not relent.<br />
Wind slammed to and fro, and Bike had to slow,<br />
Some days down to thirty per cent.</p>

<p>“You do what you please, but hard or with ease<br />
I'll best the flat provinces soon.<br />
You can't stop me long,” said Bike, growing strong,<br />
“(Though Brandon might be a lagoon.)”</p>

<p>I don't know if Bike defeated Wind's might<br />
Or Wind forced him into a pond.<br />
But when cries of “hell!” meet gusts near Qu'Apelle<br />
I'll wager the battle's still on.</p>

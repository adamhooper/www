<p><i>Challenge: explain the feeling of tapestry by writing a different
story in each paragraph.</i></p>
<p>Monday and Tuesday, Femina (my company) hosted a regional
workshop. We invited people from all over Africa. The upshot: I now
have somebody to meet when I travel to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>A month ago I spotted another white person in my neighbourhood.
That is, I saw another white person within 15 kilometres of where I
live. It was a strange sight.</p>

<p>My neighbours have gotten accustomed to me. Particularly
entertaining are the high-school girls across the street from where I
walk every morning (who will always practice their English on me as I
practice my Swahili on them). My favourite, though, is the young
child who runs up to me and hugs me whenever she sees me, calling
out, <q>Mzungu!</q> (<q>White Person</q>). She sometimes says my
actual name, <q>Adamu</q>, as an afterthought.</p>
<p>Everybody knows my name. Almost two months ago, I was invited to
sit with somebody who called me by name and seemed to know
everything about me. He bought me a soda. I assumed I had met him
but just forgotten; and so, as I am wont to do, I pretended I knew
him while trying to place his face. Ten minutes later, he introduced
himself to me: indeed, I had never met him in my life.</p>
<p>Very recently, I have started to vaguely understand the side of
Swahili which is rarely translated into English. I was told by a
co-worker, <q>nimekumisi</q>. Succinctly put, the <q>nimeku</q> part
means <q>I have done X to you</q>, where X in this case is whatever
<q>misi</q> means. I had a suspicion, but I had to ask to
double-check. Indeed, <q>misi</q> is just a Swahili-esque slang
pronunciation of <q>miss</q>. And so, <q>nimekumisi</q> translates to
<q>I've missed you!</q> I am evidently failing Flirting 101.</p>

<p>Last weekend I went to a fancy hotel with Rebecca and
<a href="http://zanzibar-caitlin.blogspot.com">Caitlin</a> for
pastries and cappuccino-related beverages. They were delicious. We
went back the next day and had more.</p>
<p>We also rode on a dala-dala ride where a full five people were
hanging out of the doorway. When boarding at one stop, with many
people crowded outside attempting to enter, the conductor actually
just got behind somebody's back and shoved him towards the doorway,
causing a domino effect which got everybody's feet off the pavement
(the only real necessity for the dala-dala to start rolling). From my
vantage point above, I asked Caitlin, who was lucky enough to be
sitting in the front seat directly beside the door, if she saw that.
She did not: her view of the scene two feet in front of her was
blocked by bodies.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in my drive home from work, a tire blew. A helpful
stranger appeared out of nowhere, jacked up the car, and replaced the
wheel with our spare. We drove him along the road a kilometre and
gave him 1000 shillings (less than $1) as thanks. Everybody was
happy.</p>

<p>And as I was walking the final stretch home, that child called me
<q>mzungu wangu</q> (<q>my mzungu</q>) and danced with me a bit.</p>
<p>The mama in my surrogate family here has discovered my undying
love for chapati. Every once in a while, she prepares it as a special
treat. I need to brace my stomach: chapati is rough on the
intestines, and I am always offered more.</p>
<p>And yesterday, I received maple fudge from my mama back home.
Maple syrup has never tasted so sweet, though that might be because I
am so unused to sugar nowadays. I spent the day explaining snow and
maple syrup and Montreal to anybody who would listen. I zoomed in on
my old home with Google Earth (the maps took hours to download). I
showed off my pictures of maple trees on my computer.</p>

<p>Is <q>home</q> my daily <q>hodi / karibu / asante, chikamoo /
marahaba, habari za kazi / ...</q> dialogue? Or is <q>home</q> maple
fudge? This morning, I ate maple fudge for breakfast in an endearing
cross-cultural confusion with my family; I hugged my little admirer
on my way to work; and I decided: for the time being, I can settle
for a little of both.</p>

<p><i>Challenge: do not use past or future tenses.</i></p>
<p>The day begins with far too little sleep, a last-minute computer
favour having stolen most of my night. I wake in time for frantic,
last-minute preparations. I complete my final bag-packing and walk
down Guy Street, downtown Montreal, one last time. I take my last
metro ride and my last Montreal bus ride.</p>
<p>The airport is unusually efficient and my flight is delayed. I doze
a little, slightly compensating for my short sleep. I finally board
the plane and sit at my window seat. I watch Montreal shrinking away:
there goes my old home; there goes my brother's home; there goes the
mountain; there goes my city.</p>

<p>The flight to London is too short, so I only catch an hour or two
of sleep. I arrive in London in what is now morning. I cannot call it
a new day, as I still need rest.</p>
<p>I take the tube downtown. I stroll through Hyde Park with a
Mozambican tourist, who is astonished by all the white people. I buy
chocolate for my prospective Tanzanian friends. I watch a couple of
Rastafarian African street performers: one of them manages to limbo
under a stick at the height of a wine bottle.</p>
<p>Taking the tube back to Heathrow, I find myself passing out
frequently. I wake and sleep, sleep and wake, desperate to stay
conscious lest I miss my flight.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Heathrow security check is uncharacteristically fast, and I
find myself waiting for the gate number to appear on the boards. I
cannot sit, as I do not want to fall asleep. Instead, I walk the
length of the terminal a dozen times, stopping in every shop, buying
nothing, whiling away the hours. I spend my last pound on an
overpriced can of soda.</p>
<p>Naturally, the flight is delayed. I strain to stay awake. As I
wait, I wonder at the demographics on the flight: most travellers to
Tanzania seem to be white or Indian.</p>
<p>I take my seat, and I am pleased to find myself surrounded by a
troup of Ismaelis. They are flying to East Africa to take part in the
Aga Khan's golden jubilee. Beside me sits a Canadian Ismaeli. Along
with several of her companions, she has a new home in Canada after Idi
Amin's expulsions of the seventies. She is delighted to return to East
Africa. I am delighted to learn more of Ismaelis and of yet another
Ugandan perspective.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The conversation runs its course in the hour of taxiing outside of
Heathrow. Finally, we begin to take off. I pass out before
lift-off.</p>
<p>I wake a few hours later, still in my seat, to an African dawn. I
continue my conversation with my neighbour. We land in Dar es
Salaam.</p>
<p>I am still missing a proper sleep, so I still cannot call this a
new day. Jetlag has now accumulated to seven hours' worth.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I step off the plane, and I am happily astonished by all the black
people. I zip through customs and, still near collapse, I wait for my
bag. I am greeted by my first new Tanzanian acquaintance, who drives
me to a long-awaited bed.</p>
<p>Along the way, I behold, in a dream-like state: the <q>queue</q>
(what Ugandans call a <q>jam</q>); a crowd cleaning the spilled
produce from an overturned trailer; civil servants sweeping the
streets; masses of limbs in nearby dala dalas (minibuses), evidence of
their being crammed to capacity; precarious towers of eggs in cartons
on the backs of bicycles weaving through traffic; the smell, a mix of
salt and smoke; and, most magical of all, <em>people</em>: everywhere,
going about their morning business.</p>
<p>While in the queue, a phone call changes my plans: instead of going
to bed, I am going to the VSO head office.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Stumbling at this point, I meet several volunteers and staff. My
plans are laid out for me. As I about to leave for bed, I am invited
to the final leg of these volunteers' training: bits of training I
need. I forego sleep and take the training exercises.</p>
<p>I receive my allowance and I leave everything of value in the safe.
I finally am driven to my temporary residence with two fellow
volunteers. I flit in and out of consciousness while taking in my
first view of the Indian ocean.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the guest house, I buy airtime for my phone. I key
it in it while climbing the stairs to my apartment. I store several
phone numbers and fire off some messages: finally, I do not feel naked
any more.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I shower for the first time in ages.</p>
<p>I fall in bed roughly sixty hours after my day began. I fall asleep
to the busy sounds of construction and the thousand natural outbursts
that African life is heir to.</p>
<p>At long last, I am back where things make no sense. I am back where
uncertainty courses through my veins. I am back home.</p>

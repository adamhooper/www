<p>Prejudice is a hard habit to shake. My opinion is that it is <em>impossible</em> to avoid prejudice: just take one look at somebody and your mind is bound to make various assumptions. Not that there's anything wrong with that: it's just the way we are, as human beings.</p>
<p>One glance at somebody in Kampala should be plenty to form a rather accurate estimation of that person's <q>worth</q>. As a simplification, I present a scale. Here is how to determine a person's value, from one to ten:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Clean clothes: without clean clothes, you're worthless. Even beggars have clean clothes.</li>
 <li>Clean, tear-free clothes: clothes without holes or rips are a step up.</li>
 <li>Clean, new clothes: clothes which show no signs of fraying are even better (and sorry, obviously-second-hand clothes, such as t-shirts, don't count). Congratulations: if you've made it this far, you've reached the first major tier of respectability.</li>
 <li>Clean, new clothes and a cell phone: you're important enough to talk to people. Airtime and battery life aren't necessary: you can just <em>pretend</em> there's somebody on the line with you. But flaunt that cell phone, because it's a sign of wealth.</li>
 <li>Clean, new clothes and a <em>nice</em> cell phone: wow, great phone! Again, airtime and battery aren't necessary. But you can play <em>games</em> on that phone, so that more passers-by will see it.</li>
 <li>Clean, new clothes, a nice cell phone, and a watch: the watch is great because it's always visible. It doesn't matter if the watch doesn't work: anybody who asks you for the time evidently doesn't have a functional watch, so you're better than they are anyway.</li>
 <li>Clean, new clothes, a nice cell phone, a watch, and creased pants: the crease in the pants means you have an iron at home, which means you can afford electricity.</li>
 <li>Clean, new, creased clothes, a nice cell phone, a watch, and accessories: a cell phone holder, a necklace, or other flashy objects show that you have money to burn. Be sure all accessories are clearly visible.</li>
 <li>A car: you've reached a major plateau of wealth. The bigger the better: bigger cars get right-of-way in high-traffic areas.</li>
 <li>White skin: you're so respectable, you're practically inhuman.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a rather crude scale: you <em>could</em> wear a watch and not have a cell phone, for instance. But make sure you don't get accessories if you're too low on the scale: if you have many accessories but no cell phone, then you're obviously trying too hard. Finally, there are other sundry modifications which will also affect people's opinion of you:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Riding on a boda: it might be a short distance, and you can afford not to walk.</li>
 <li>Wearing a tie: you've got a respectable job. (Side-note: ties are to be worn short. That's the only fashion trend in Kampala.)</li>
 <li>Talking with other people who are higher in the social chain: there must be a reason they respect you.</li>
 <li>Wearing headphones: they imply an MP3 player. (This display is somewhat rare, perhaps because theft is likely.)</li>
 <li>Being married: a wedding ring commands an <em>enormous</em> amount of respect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond purely aesthetic considerations, further discriminations can be made in conversation with somebody or by vising his home. (Alarm bells should be ringing back home: I used <q>his</q> instead of a gender-neutral pronoun! ...Let's not go there, okay?) A quick glance around a home can reveal:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cleanliness: All homes should be impeccably clean. (I imagine this is more than purely cosmetic: with all homes being partially open to the outdoors, pest control is necessary.)</li>
 <li>Candles: candles indicate poverty, despite the fact that there's no electricity a third of the time. Instead, use a lantern, a lamp (flashlight), or nothing.</li>
 <li>Pictures: a picture of HME President Museveni is a nice touch; a Pope looks good, too.</li>
 <li>Children: producing more children contributes more to the future of Uganda. A respectable patriot should have a large family.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a mzungu, I've had to stay longer than a month to grasp some of these indicators. But once you start, you just can't stop: walking down the street, I now automatically categorize everybody I see into my dozens of neatly-defined wealth brackets. Now, don't get on my case about <q>prejudice</q>: everybody else does it, too; and they're even better at it. You <em>do</em> want me to fit in here, right?</p>
<p><b><i>Fun Fact</i></b>: According to the United Nations Population Division, the average age of Uganda's 28 million people is just 15.3 years. In Japan and most European countries, average age ranges between 40 and 43 years. Most Ugandans are under 15 years of age!</p>

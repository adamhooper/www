<p>My second surfing experience was much more fruitful than the first, though far less exciting. In <a href="http://www.adamhooper.com/blog/California/Surfing_.adam">my first surfing adventure</a>, the waves were behemoths bearing pain and drowningness. Here, the waves were... wait, were there waves?</p>
<p>The upside: it was easy to get up and go when the waves <em>did</em> come. In fact, we started to show off: I actually high-fived somebody while we were both surfing! Okay, so it's not dolphin-jumping, but at least it's a start.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there were tons and tons (and tons) of other surfers. It ended up being even more dangerous than last time, because everybody was a beginner so boards and people were flying everywhere. We all survived.</p>

<p>Santa Cruz is really hot and summer-y.</p>
<p>As is becoming the norm, I took pictures of this event in <a href="http://adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Santa%20Cruz%20Surfing">my Santa Cruz Surfing photo album</a>, but there aren't many.</p>
<p>That night we went for dinner at a really cool restaurant in downtown mountain view. Vince brought along his friend <a href="http://ajillstory.blogspot.com">Jill</a>, who stayed the long weekend and is probably wondering why I took so long to write this blog entry. Hi, Jill!</p>

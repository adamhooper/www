<p>The last two weeks flew by. Now <a href="http://veenix.blogspot.com">Vince</a> is <em>really</em> gone. As of Friday, Brian is gone, too. They're dropping off like flies! Vince, Brian: you will both be missed.</p>
<p>I haven't blogged because there's not much worth blogging about. I probably haven't even taken any pictures in the last two weeks. Oh well.</p>
<p>I have two more weeks of work before I head home. This is the point where I <em>would</em> talk about how I feel about that sort of thing... except I never blog about how I feel, see? So suffice it to say, I've got two weeks of work left.</p>

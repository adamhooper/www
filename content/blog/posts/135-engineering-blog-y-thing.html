<p>There seem to be two aspects to my world these days: real life and engineering. Both vary from stressful to challenging to, at times, rewarding.</p>
<p>Most people who read this blog, I suspect, read it to find out about real life, not about engineering. But I feel I have a fair amount to contribute in the latter category, so I hereby announce the grand opening of <a href="http://adamhooper.com/eng">The Engineering Section of my website</a>, catering to a new potential group of readers with wildly different interests.</p>
<p>My engineering section is blog-like, but is completely separate from this, my actual blog. I encourage interested software engineers to subscribe to the feed in my Engineering section, as I encourage my current readers to stay tuned <em>here</em> while I write my next <em>proper</em> blog post involving a guy wearing a cat as a hat.</p>

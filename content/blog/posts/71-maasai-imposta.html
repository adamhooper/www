<p>Beaches being beaches and white people being rich, some Maasai warriors earn a living making crafts and selling them to tourists. I have a Maasai friend who used to do this.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon, Alex, Caitlin and I found ourselves relaxing on a beach at Cholo's, an incredibly chill beach-side bar. Cholo's, as <a href="http://zanzibar-caitlin.blogspot.com/2007/07/nungwi-and-real-live-economics.html">Caitlin's Blog explains</a>, is run by what we refer to as impostafarians (Rastafarians minus their religious beliefs). It may be the most relaxed place in all of Africa.</p>
<p>On this particular afternoon, we were disturbed from our relaxing by a raised voice. looking up, I saw a Maasai warrior attempting to sell his crafts to the tourists fifteen feet away. The voice we heard was that of one of the Rasta owners of Cholo's.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It was clear the Rasta was drunk: he began to shout, <q>toka!</q> over and over again. (<q>Toka!</q> is an extremely rude and emphatic, <q>get out!</q>) He had somehow acquired a Maasai stick (a half-stick, half-club just over a foot long). He used the stick to try and rally nearby dogs to his cause: the peaceful dogs were comically unhelpful rounding up the Maasai. We had to turn away and laugh.</p>
<p>The Maasai stood his ground, clearly displaying that he was unafraid. The Rasta stormed off, repeating <q>toka!</q> with every step. The Maasai seemed to be waiting for the Rasta to calm down so that he could comply while keeping his self-respect.</p>
<p>But the Rasta drunkenly decided to turn back and argue his point once more. A couple of other Maasai who were strolling by came to investigate; a couple of Rastas also appeared to see what their co-worker was up to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All parties (minus the drunk) seemed to understand each other. The drunk looked quite happy to have company: he used his friends to hold him back while he lunged at the Maasai. His friends gladly played along, restraining and disarming him.</p>
<p>The Maasai all watched.</p>
<p>I should interject: Maasai warriors are almost invariably armed and skilled. If one Maasai warrior were to square off against all three Rastas, I have no doubt the Maasai could send them running. Or kill them. With three Maasai, the prospect of a fight is a joke. All six parties (yes, even the one with addled senses) knew this.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It looked like everybody was satisfied. But one of the Maasai must have muttered a taunt, because all of a sudden the Rastas leapt into action. One ran and fetched empty beer bottles and hurled one at a Maasai. The throw was hilariously inaccurate: it sailed harmlessly into the sea. Had the throw been more accurate, the bottle might have hit us (ten feet away from its target).</p>
<p>Another Rasta with a makeshift weapon received a threatening lunge from a Maasai who had unsheathed his blade. This, too, was ten feet away from us.</p>
<p>The Maasai proudly walked off together. The inept bottle-thrower tried his luck again, receiving a threatening, unflinching glare in return.</p>

<p>We left.</p>
<p>I can draw many morals from this story. One moral is that there is some element of tribalism in Tanzania (though I still blindly contest the tensions do not run as deep in Tanzania as in Uganda or Kenya). Another moral is that even after six months here, I can still experience something completely unexpected.</p>
<p>The real lesson, to me, is more internal: I was siding with the Maasai.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Why? I can rationalize all I want that the Maasai were acting less childish or more diplomatic; I can argue the Rastas had no right to behave the way they did; I can even claim that the Maasai would win if the situation erupted into violence.</p>
<p>All of these reasons, though valid, are dishonest. I sided with the Maasai for the reason I wrote in the first paragraph: I have a Maasai friend. I picked sides before there even <em>was</em> a situation.</p>
<p>Whose side did <em>you</em> pick?</p>

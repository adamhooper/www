<p>Was there always so much great stuff on the Internet, or am I just better at sifting through it nowadays?</p>
<p>Through a fantastic video-browsing program (from parodies to porn and everything in between) called <a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy</a>, which I heartily recommend, I stumbled across a short film entitled <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/7/massacre_at_murambai/">Massacre at Murambi</a>. A beautiful, five-minute-long work of art. <a href="http://www.mediathatmattersfest.org/7/massacre_at_murambai/">Watch it</a>.</p>

<p>
Life, for me, is now a phase<br/>
Of frantic preparation<br/>
Peppered, soaked, and madly braised<br/>
With keen anticipation.
</p>

<p>
<q>Now</q> is little but delays;<br/>
But thrill will not be mired:<br/>
Every day I can appraise<br/>
How much my heart buoys higher.
</p>

<p>
Flames have set my mind ablaze;<br/>
Excitement rolls like thunder.<br/>
Simply put, these are the days<br/>
Of miracle and wonder.
</p>

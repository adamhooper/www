<p>Last night I ran my final run in Central Park. Toward the end, I
was struck by a sudden urge to sprint to the northern tip of the
reservoir and revel in the midtown skyline.</p>
<p><img src="http://adamhooper.com/images/blog/nyc-parting-reflections.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I have stared at the skyline many times before, of course, but
final occasions afford some unexpected ruminations. I peered at the
skyline, the reflection of the skyline, and my memories of my last
big departure: Dar es Salaam.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I had declared the city of Dar es Salaam—the city
itself—somewhat unpleasant: flat, hot, dirty, stressful, and
sometimes dangerous. My departure last year was painful exclusively
because of the people I was leaving: it had nothing to do with the
city itself.</p>
<p>New York, paradoxically, produced the same emotion. The skyline is
inspiring and beautiful: Rockefeller Center, the Chrysler Building,
the Empire State Building, and countless other edifices stand guard
over their remarkable siblings, obscuring from view but still hinting
at a vibrant, never-asleep city encompassing vagrants, aloof
businesspeople, quintessential weeknight revellers, and millions of
families and roommates and lovers and loners, all living their unique
lives. Yet as astonishing as the city itself may be, it is lifeless
in comparison to its shimmering reflection.</p>
<p>In the skyline, the Empire State Building is a feat of
architecture; in the reflection, I see the friends and family who
accompanied me to the top. In the skyline, the Chrysler Building
towers impressively; in the reflection, I notice it from downtown on
Broadway while walking to the subway after work with a colleague or
two, at least one of us never failing to complain about the
freezing-cold air conditioners, pedestrian-traffic-inducing male
models, and revolting smells wafting out of a department store.</p>

<p>“We should hire models to stand outside our office.”</p>
<p>“Let's buy the scent, too.”</p>
<p>The millions of households are different in the reflection: they
are millions of abstract sketches of the families I joined here: they
hold their own dramas, their own video game championships, their own
morning schedules, their own parties, their own life lessons, and,
with New York flair, their own <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/nyregion/thecity/17wind.html">neighbours
of undignified proximity</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Above the water, New York is a mosaic of cultures. In the
reflection on the reservoir, the only culture is my own: the
amalgamation of all of the above, it encompasses barely-understood
experiences and half-unexplored relationships. Millions of others'
worlds dance around mine like stars, all begging to be investigated.</p>
<p>And in this personal sense, my New York departure is strikingly
similar to my Tanzania one. In spite of how objectively fantastic New
York may be, the skyline is meaningless without the people who make
it <em>my</em> New York.</p>
<p>Friends and family constantly ask me why I want to leave. Am I
running from something? Am I running toward something else? I look
into this reflection of my past year, and I see myself the year
before and the year before that one: departures cyclically
transforming into arrivals, two reflective experiences I would be
self-depriving to forgo.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I am running for the sake of running, loving every minute of it.</p>

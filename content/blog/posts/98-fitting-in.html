<p>Today, on the way from Mengo hill to Mulago hill, I tried to be as <q>normal</q> as possible:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Hopped on a mutatu, edging my way ahead of another person in that social game of chicken which is the result of a complete lack of lines. I had waited long enough, so I deserved to get the next matatu. <em>Failure</em>: I asked the conductor, in English, whether this matatu was going to New Park. I still can't figure out how everybody else figures this out.</li>
 <li>Rode the matatu to New Park, scrunched to the side. <em>Failure</em>: I couldn't help myself: I <em>had</em> to look out the window as we rode, because there is so much to see. (Everybody usually just stares straight ahead.)</li>
 <li>Got off the matatu in an orderly fashion.</li>
 <li>Made my way from where the matatu left me to New Park without even getting confused about directions.</li>
 <li>Walked to the proper corner of New Park to where I knew the Mulago matatus lie in wait.</li>
 <li><em>Failure</em>: I asked someone whether this was the matatu to Mulago. While I was asking, another person jumped into the last seat. So I had to go into another mutatu and wait for it to fill up.</li>
 <li><em>Failure</em>: after saying <em>webale</em> to the person who directed me to that mutatu, I simply did not understand the long, fast stream of Luganda (the major language in Kampala) he gave in response.</li>
 <li><em>Failure</em>: there were two children crammed in next to me. They stared at me and called me <em>mzungu</em>. (I don't think it's common for mzungus to take matatus in the morning, especially alone, solely because most mzungus are too lofty to do so.)</li>
 <li>At an appropriate moment, softly (everyone speaks softly here) called out <em>konducta</em> (I still don't know whether that's Luganda or just <q>conductor</q> with an English-style accent) and paid my fare.</li>
 <li>At an appropriate moment, softly called out <em>masao</em> so the matatu would stop and let me off.</li>
 <li>Gave a completely nonchalant and impersonal <em>webale</em> (<q>thank you</q>) to the conductor and received a completely nonchalant and impersonal <em>kale</em> in return.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, while I may make mistakes, they're mostly unavoidable, owing to my being white. As I walked away from the matatu, I felt a bit of pride: I am now at the point where not only am I comfortable with a normal Kampala lifestyle, but also my fellow passengers can see a mzungu who isn't a complete tourist.</p>

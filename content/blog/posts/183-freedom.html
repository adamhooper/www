<p>Freedom, not democracy, is the basis of our society.</p>

<p>Hundreds of years ago, political figures commissioned art. Now, they tolerate it. Artists spray-painted London's South Bank when doing so was illegal, and amateur skateboarders kick-flipped in before their parents could buy elbowpads. All the politicians had to do, when asked, was set up lights and tell the cleaners not to bother scrubbing.</p>

<p>Even that concession is a fight, of course, and the powers that be <a href="http://cooler.mpora.com/news/europe/southbank-skate-park-set-to-close.html">sometimes talk of closing the 30-year-old park</a> to make way for shops. Skaters and bikers, a tiny minority of South Bankers, have fought to keep the park alive.</p>
<p>It makes sense to trust in minorities: graffiti artists and skateboarders are experts on graffiti and skateboarding. Their elected representatives probably don't know how to stamp or ollie, so nobody expects them to propose a skate park, out of the blue, at the next city council meeting.</p>

<p>But eventually they will. Leaders aren't there to <em>lead</em> their people: they're there to <em>follow</em> them.</p>

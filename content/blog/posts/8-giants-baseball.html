<p>On Wednesday all the Google interns were herded onto buses and led to San Francisco to watch a Giants baseball game. We were given free tickets and $20 worth of coupons to spend on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">beer</span>whatever we wanted.</p>
<p>Baseball is a sport in which players throw a tiny white ball around and whack at it with sticks and run around. But the majority of the game is spent waiting around. All in all, how fun can a baseball game be?</p>
<p>The coolest part: between the top and bottom of the fifth inning, the Jumbotron showed a message just for us interns. I managed to photograph it, among other things, in <a href="http://adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Giants%20Baseball">my Giants Baseball photo album</a>. As requested by a couple of very fine people back home, I got a picture of myself with a hot dog and beer.</p>

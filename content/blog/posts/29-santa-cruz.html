<p>In celebration of [insert excuse here], Google took <em>all</em> its Mountain View engineers to Santa Cruz for a fun-filled, fully free day at the beach. There are thousands of engineers.</p>
<p>The ride was uneventful. When we arrived, we were greeted by an arcade with about 50 video games, all free. But what's an arcade when there's a beach? But what's a beach when there's beer? A slew of interns grabbed free beer and free snacks, and used a free volleyball court to play free volleyball. Afterwards we got free food and then took our free passes to ride on the free amusement park rides.</p>
<p>We went home and rode on two free scooters, then we ate free food, and went home.</p>

<p>And I haven't gotten a free minute between then and now to blog about it.</p>
<p>Photos explain it far better. They're in <a href="http://adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Santa%20Cruz">my Santa Cruz photo album</a>.</p>

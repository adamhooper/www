<p>I will be leaving Montreal in August 2007, to live in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, for (at least) six months. There, I will be working with an <abbr title="Non-Governmental Organization">NGO</abbr> called <a href="http://www.chezasalama.com/">Femina HIP</a>. <a href="http://www.chezasalama.com/G-Behind/view_partner.php?id=384">Here is a description of Femina HIP</a>.</p>
<p>Consider this entry a revival of my blog. I expect I will be writing fairly regularly once I land and settle in Tanzania. Until then, I will be rushing around, attending training and collecting paperwork.</p>
<p>This time around, I will use a new blog format. I found that my Uganda blog was weak because I was trying to convey ideas which are inherently abstract and confusing. I also simply wrote far too much. My Tanzania blog will be an amalgamation of writing exercises: each post will tackle an arbitrary writing challenge (for instance, <q>an entire post without the letter 'e'</q>). My reasoning:</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
 <li>Challenges are fun.</li>
 <li>Well-selected challenges can keep my entries shorter and more focused.</li>
 <li>I hope to improve my writing skills.</li>
 <li>Writing with a silly limitation is a metaphor for the silly limitation that is writing. These are all just words! These are not my thoughts. I should remember that while writing, and I hope for my readers to remember it while reading. A tweak in the medium may accomplish that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned. Come August, things are going to get crazy.</p>

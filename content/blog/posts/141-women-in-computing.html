<p>Full disclaimer: I am a man.</p>
<p>And that, many assume, makes me better at computing than if I were
a woman.</p>
<p>To me, such reasoning is, on the surface, patently absurd. What
possible difference should testosterone or estrogen make in typing or
programming skills? Yet here I work, sifting through resumes and
interviewing candidates during my last few days of software
engineering, and nary a woman has sat across from me. All my engineer
coworkers, past and present, are men. Even at school, lecture halls
infusing 200 students with computer knowledge would never seat 10
women. I can only conclude that there is a huge absence of women in
computing.</p>

<p>And so, runs the thinking, <em>it must be women's choice</em>.</p>
<p>Must it?</p>
<p>At work, I code in a programming
language called Ruby, using a set of tools called Rails. These are
both relatively new technologies, netting a fresh generation of
programmers. In April of this year, a conference was held, the <a href="http://gogaruco.com/">Golden
Gate Ruby Conference</a>, in which a male programmer presented his
data storage and retrieval project. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mattetti/couchdb-perform-like-a-pr0n-star">His
presentation</a> showcased soft-core porn—in fact, it was entirely
themed on porn. The six professional women attending this
professional conference of 200 professionals were, I assume, horribly
offended (judging by <a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/gender-and-sex-at-gogaruco/">some</a>
<a href="http://lizkeogh.com/2009/04/29/i-am-not-a-pr0n-star-avoiding-unavoidable-associations/">online</a>
<a href="http://twitter.com/LindaEskin/status/1645011188">reactions</a>).
Many men stand in solidarity with these women, but others do not: a
notable backer of this sexually degrading imagery being displayed in
a professional setting is the originator of Rails, a role model for
aspiring programmers, who boldly states, “<a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/39-im-an-r-rated-individual">I'm
an R rated individual</a>.” Many men (and few women) <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/CouchDB_talk#Supportive">agree</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Many.</p>
<p>Another software hero is the
founder of the Free Software Foundation. Most of my readers have
probably heard of Linux; without this programming giant, Linux (and,
indeed, most of the Free Software movement) might never have come to
be. This man, a famous role model, speaks at schools and conferences.
This July, at one of his talks, he declared that women who do not use
the EMACS text editor he wrote are “EMACS virgins,” whose “holy
duty” is to be relieved of their virginity. When one (male)
attendee brought to his attention that such statements can easily be
interpreted as denigrating and sexist, <a href="http://opensourcetogo.blogspot.com/2009/07/emailing-richard-stallman.html">his
response</a> did not address these concerns at all. Legions of
computer programmers <a href="http://mdzlog.alcor.net/2009/07/13/backlash-feminism-considered-harmful/">leaped
to the defence of his female virgin joke</a>, with <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/EMACS_virgins_joke">a
vast array of explanations and excuses</a>.</p>
<p>With role models like these, who loudly
protest that they hold women in the highest regard while
simultaneously insulting and dismissing them, what happens with
aspiring computer geeks?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Women are passively and routinely
excluded. Who would use Rails after many in the Rails community
publicly stated her rights and dignity are less important than a
cheap joke? Who would use EMACS after being told by the author that
she must use it to relieve herself and her female friends of their
virginity? These comments have nothing to do with computers and
everything to do with a deep-rooted absence of empathy and common
sense. And these are just the role models: individuals, outside of
the public eye, are quick to judge women as less talented, based
solely on their gender.</p>
<p>With such a shortage of computer
women in schools and jobs, young male computer experts fail to learn
a balanced view of reality. There is <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki">a
whole world</a> of rational arguments and disgusting truths about
male behaviour, but few speak of them in the computer world: for most
male students, our prevailing cultural norms remain unchallenged.</p>
<p>This patriarchy is
self-perpetuating: the exclusion of women leads to distorted male
perspectives, leading to further exclusion of women.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Some women's computer users
groups have sprung up and flourished, of course, but I argue that
their necessity is a flaw in computer culture: proof that women
struggle to find their places in a culture where they are perceived
as second-rate citizens.</p>
<p>I feel the best recourse is
education. Read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism">feminism</a>
(which is <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/feminist-is-not-a-dirty-word-20080914-4g8z.html">not
a dirty word</a>), <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki">feminism
in computers</a>, and maybe a <a href="http://fugitivus.wordpress.com/">feminist
blog</a> or <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/">two</a>. Reality
paints a serious, horrifying picture of men and predicts a long,
painful battle for women, in computer circles and elsewhere. As a
man, my level of participation is slightly limited; yet I vow to
always cheer from the sidelines, and I promise to do my best to
educate myself and others.</p>
<p>Sifting through more resumes,
interviewing more candidates, I find myself hopeless, unable to
envision a society in which women and men program computers as
equals. This is a heart-wrenching loss for computer-savvy women, who
are demeaned at every turn, and for the computing world as a whole,
which would otherwise hold twice the talent.</p>

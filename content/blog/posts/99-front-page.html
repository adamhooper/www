<p>Uganda made the front page of BBC news today, with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6548107.stm">a story about a Mabira protest</a>.</p>
<p>At the time the deaths began, I was actually in a taxi heading into the city. As Ugandans ran from police bullets, I ran from Ugandans: lest I be mistaken for an Asian. I particularly enjoyed my boda driver negotiations while in the midst of fleeing masses: <q>You don't care how much it costs. Get on.</q></p>
<p>No, I didn't die.</p>

<p>My last post described how stepping outside your doorstep is always an adventure. I have certainly proved my point. Naturally, today is a completely different day: I am not even remotely afraid because of yesterday's events.</p>
<p>Actually, this marks a perfect segway between two blog posts. I left off saying that every time you walk out the door a story unfolds. That is certainly the case.</p>
<p>A future blog post about perspectives will use this protest as a case study. I'll leave off with a couple of quotes from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6548107.stm">that BBC story</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"People were demonstrating peacefully when there was a misunderstanding with the police. All of a sudden they opened fire," environmental activist Frank Muramuzi told Reuters news agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The BBC's Sarah Grainger in Kampala says protesters threw stones at the police and set fire to vehicles.</blockquote>
<p>Now, you, fellow reader, should remember that truth is difficult to find in Africa. The BBC is good enough to quote its sources for most of its information. I'll step out on a limb and say that these two quotes are somewhat contradictory, as chronology can be a bit fuzzy. Even more blatantly obviously, these quotes are part of larger stories: the quotes' contexts have been removed in interests of brevity.</p>
<p>You're not going to find out exactly what happened. Give up: nobody knows. Truth doesn't work that way. Instead, let me ask a rhetorical meta-question:</p>
<ul>
 <li>What did Frank Muramuzi experience to make him say what he said?</li>
 <li>What did Sarah Grainger experience to make her say what she said?</li>
 <li>What did the BBC journalist experience to make him/her say what he/she said?</li>
 <li>What did Adam Hooper experience to make him say what he said?</li>
</ul>
<p>Stay tuned. I have two more serious blog entries lined up (with a white-water-rafting experience in between). My last entry will discuss this question in more depth.</p>

<p><i>Challenge: apply one horrible pun in each paragraph.</i></p>
<p>I am an omnivore. When asked to justify my stance, I consider studying the nutritional value of meat, cultural norms, and so on. I <em>consider</em> looking into these things. But soon enough, I give it up as a lost cause: I eat meat because I like it, period. And now, I can no longer be intimidated by claims that I would <em>chicken</em> out when confronted with the task of killing an animal: I have done it. Saturday, I killed a chicken.</p>
<p><em>Meat</em> Paula. Paula grew up in a backyard somewhere in eastern Tanzania. She laid eggs, which were eaten by her Tanzanian owners. One day, she was deemed less necessary than the 5000 shillings (USD$5) she could fetch her owner at the market. Her feet were bound, and she was carried to the market in downtown Morogoro. She was bought by a Swahili teacher. She spent one night in a convent, surrounded by Swahili lessons taped along the walls of her room. The next morning, she was lifted by her wings, in one hand, by a Swahili teacher. She was then passed to a man named Adam, who held her in the same fashion. She was carried by Adam to an outdoor area for cooking, where she was set aside while other foods were being prepared. She was afraid of Adam, who had a habit of staring at her when he was not busy. Paula watched Adam, the Swahili teacher, and two other students prepare side dishes. Eventually, Paula was brought to a spot on the ground.
Her wings were pinned by Adam's left foot while her legs were pinned by his right foot. Her heart was beating hard enough for Adam to feel her pulse. Her head was held up by Adam's left hand, while her neck was sawed apart by the knife in Adam's right hand.</p>

<p>The experience was somewhat cathartic for Adam. It was even more cathartic for Paula, though: about as cathartic as you can get.</p>
<p>My long-time readers know by now that I rarely share my feelings in my blog. I will not break that tradition here. Instead, I will posit here a question&mdash;or rather, I will <em>question</em> my reader's <em>positions</em>.
Have you killed any person or animal with which you sympathized? (Pets count, though you have to have been watching at the very least.) Why?
I have heard it said that we are lords of all animals and we should rule them wisely (I <em>am</em> in a convent). Do we have that right? Why or why not?
And, most interesting to me today (though somewhat rhetorical): are you religious?</p>
<p>I ask about your spirituality in the <em>spirit</em> of abstract reasoning which hits me when I am out of my element. While sawing away Paula's life, it occurred to me that it may be easier for a religious person to kill than for an atheist.
In the former case, my God wants this chicken dead and I am performing His will. In the latter case, this is simply a conflict of desires between me and Paula. I hold all the power and all the responsibility for the outcome, so my killing Paula is tantamount to my declaring myself ultimately right in the question of whether or not she should live.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>God or not, I can reformulate the religion question completely: am I ultimately responsible for Paula's death, given that she would not have lived any longer had I not killed her? This is a different question, but not <em>very</em> different from the <q>are you an atheist?</q> question in my mind. <em>Mind</em> you, I am still ignorant of all the different religions out there and their official answers.</p>
<p>How many soldiers, militia, rebels, or extremists are atheists or agnostic? I suspect the proportion may be rather low, <em>because</em> of the question of who is responsible for a killing.
And so I encourage my atheist and agnostic readers not to pass up any reasonable opportunity to kill something in cold blood: it may just test your faith.</p>

<p><i>Challenge: In the spirit of Swahili: never use the letters X or Q; all S's must be prounounced hard (excluding in an <q>sh</q> pair); C's may only be used as part of a <q>ch</q> pair. Exception: proper names.</i></p>
<p><q>Ninajifunza Kiswahili.</q> I say this to every Tanzanian I meet here in Morogoro. In English: I am learning Swahili.</p>
<p>My previous entry ended halfway through my first day in Dar es Salaam. In the intervening time I have had many a small adventure. Nothing to write home about: I have written of <a href="/blog/Uganda/Sipi">the same flavour of event</a> in my Uganda blog. Read <a href="http://zanzibar-caitlin.blogspot.com/2007/08/logic.html">this blog entry by Caitlin</a> for the general idea. I rode in a dala-dala (minibus) so full that only one of my feet touched the ground; I rode in a tax (taxi) through a pseudo-ditch in the road near where I now live; and so on. Little stuff.</p>

<p>A dozen or so of us wazungu (white people) are staying together here in Morogoro for language training. The teaching is intense; happily, it lasts only until mid-afternoon. I am left with enough time to walk around the gorgeous town. I attempt to speak Swahili with the people I meet, with varying amounts of understanding. I am very far from being fluent, but I improve vastly each day.</p>
<p>I get great food, an evil shower, and amazing company: I am enjoying myself.</p>
<p>A week from now I will return to Dar es Salaam, where I will attempt to find a home and a life for the following months.</p>

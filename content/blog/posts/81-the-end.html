<p><i>Challenge: write at least one negative and one positive in every paragraph.</i></p>
<p>The dreams have begun again. I am back home with my family and friends. Everything is normal, yet it all feels wrong. Somebody mentions Tanzania. I wake up, relieved.</p>
<p>I cannot wait to see everybody back home. Yet as the dreams suggest, I am reticent to do so. The reason is culture shock.</p>

<p>It is termed <q>reverse culture shock</q> when returning home. Reverse culture shock is, to me at least, far more difficult to handle than the forwards variety. Regular culture shock is realizing, in Tanzania, <q>this child really could be funded through school for the cost of a cup of coffee a day.</q> Reverse culture shock is realizing, in Montreal, <q>this cup of coffee could be funding that child through school.</q> Every object is seen through the eyes of somebody who does not need it; every statement is heard from people who suddenly do not understand.</p>
<p>Before hitting home, I will be using my opportunity to travel. All I need are my beloved backpack, my deteriorating clothes, and my passport. I look forward to meeting with new places and friends and foods and musics. I will doubtless run into uncomfortable situations, and I stand no chance of learning the fine details of any other cultures: these certainties are but refrains in the song of life.</p>
<p>Ten days remain until the end of my contract.</p>

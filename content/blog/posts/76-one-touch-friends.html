<p><i>Challenge: I can only provide a fleeting glimpse at last weekend's magic; do so with only one sentence per picture.</i></p>

Saturday morning, Caitlin, Rebecca and I departed from Stone Town in a dala-dala to Jambiani, on the eastern side of Zanzibar's Unguja island.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><%= image_tag 'blog/tz-otf2.jpg' %><br />
We ate on the beach and played one-touch football (soccer without dribbling) with some local youths, who later took pictures of themselves and us.

They must have liked us because we understood Swahili, so some of them showed off for us.
</p>

We pushed a dhow into the water for a fisherman.

The beach and the people were beautiful.

One young boy was remarkably placid as his brother let us torment him.

On the beach outside our guest house, we chatted with three children about school, English, and Ze Comedy Show.
</p>

We ate a delicious local meal at a restaurant, served by a very sweet waitor.

My camera could not capture even a fraction of the beauty of the stars above and around us: a fitting metaphor, I felt.

After dinner we met Mohammed, the fascinating head of a local NGO.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><%= image_tag 'blog/tz-otf11.jpg' %><br />
The next day, he lured us to his restaurant for lunch.

We again ate local food: plenty of octopus, chicken, and coconut.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><%= image_tag 'blog/tz-otf13.jpg' %><br />
Soon after, walking along the beach, we could not resist to investigate a well-advertised restaurant: the ads told us to <q>Ask for Captain Cook</q>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><%= image_tag 'blog/tz-otf14.jpg' %><br />
We did so, and Captain Cook (so-named because he is both a cook and a captain) rewarded us with beers and conversation.

We left Jambiani soon afterwards, as suddenly as we had come.

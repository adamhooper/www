<p><i>Challenge: In the spirit of backpacking, visit one place in
each paragraph.</i></p>
<p>My weekend started Friday morning in Dar es Salaam. I packed a
small backpack with essentials and hopped on the nearest dala-dala to
get to the main bus station.</p>
<p>The bus, like any self-respecting African bus, was a land of
adventure in its own right. Upon departure, the bus immediately
pulled into a gas station for repairs: it was clearly broken before
it started accepting passengers. The bus practically limped its
entire journey; in the end, the ride was ten hours long when it
should have been six. Squished between two inconsiderately large men,
I whiled away the hours by alternating between sleeping and leaning
away from whichever neighbour was least awake.</p>

<p>My first visit to Dodoma (Tanzania's capital, in name if not in
deed) was peaceful and pleasant. I enjoyed beer, mzungu food
(fajitas, with chapati instead of tortillas), and my first hot shower
in ages (which was welcome, considering how cold it gets in the
mornings in Dodomaâ€”yes, lower twenties feels cold to me now).</p>
<p>Saturday morning's car ride was another wonderful journey. The
four-wheel-drive car managed to break down partially along the way;
but it, too, was able to limp to its destination. One hour of paved
road and two hours of bumpy dirt road passed quickly. At one point we
crossed a couple of broken-down lorries. We carried one of the many
stranded travellers to the next village. He said they had been broken
down since the day previous. We gave him some bread. I was proud
that, between the four of us wazungu, we could understand and speak
all the Swahili we needed.</p>
<p>Kibaya is a village in the middle of nowhere, and it is
inexplicably large. My first impression is that a paved road would
make it a wonderful trading hub in Northeastern Tanzania. When Ernest
Hemmingway visited Kibaya, he reportedly ate lunch at what was the
only place to eat, and left before needing to sleep at what was the
only place to stay. Maybe he agreed with my conclusion. We ate lunch
at the Taj Mahal restaurant (which serves only Tanzanian food and has
no relation to India whatsoever).</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we visited a Maasai market. The Maasai are
world-renowned: nomadic cattle herders, they wear jewellery around
their limbs, around their necks, and through big holes in their ears.
They closely guard their culture: their shoes may be made from
recycled lorry tires (a tradition which cannot be more than fifty
years old), but they will defend to the death their age-old rights to
practice FGM. Alas, I digress. The market supplies cows, clothes, and
crafts.</p>
<p>In the night, we walked up to a hill which overlooks Kibaya. There
we put up our tents in what is undoubtedly the most beautiful place I
have ever camped. Miraculously, I had a weak stomach: I got to use
the bathroom stall many times, staring out its open door to the
magnificent view below. I woke ridiculously early for the return
journey.</p>
<p>The bus home was, naturally, another adventure. It was full of
Maasai. The two older Maasai women sitting with me had stolen the
window seat I had booked; I let them have it, knowing they have
enough problems. In my aisle seat, I was struck by hands, feet, legs,
buttocks, elbows, shoulders, heads, chickens, and a bag which jumped
out of the luggage rack. The bus was grossly overfull: at every
checkpoint, the conductors would herd away many of the passengers,
who would walk across the checkpoint in case the legally-stipulated
head count was performed. Twenty metres later, they would jump back
onto the bus and we would continue our trek.</p>

<p>At long last, I found myself back in Dar es Salaam.</p>

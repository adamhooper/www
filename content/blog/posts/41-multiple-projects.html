<p>Back when I started at university, I'd be able to immerse myself in projects. I accomplished quite a few things, one project at a time.</p>
<p>Now things are different. I'm taking only four courses this semester, but three of them have semester-long projects. I am currently working on:</p>
<ul>
 <li>An Internet version of the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_%28game%29">Pit</a>, using the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac">Twisted Python</a> framework for the Internet part and client. The end goal: code an AI player for the game (language undecided: either C++ or Python, probably).</li>
 <li>A simulation of a distributed computing network. This involves a simulated local network of processes (using an event queue) as well as a <em>real</em> network component (using <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/">MPI</a>). Language: C++.</li>
 <li>A <a href="http://www.adamhooper.com:4242/hypernotes/hypernotes.jnlp">sticky-notes application</a>. I really like this one. Language: Java.</li>
 <li>(Work, not school:) A medical-imaging application, using <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/">Qt</a>, <a href="http://vtk.org/">VTK</a>, and <a href="http://itk.org/">ITK</a>. Language: C++ (and each of the libraries has a different idea of how C++ should be written, leading to acute pains in my neck.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Switching between projects takes a change in mindset. As soon as I get immersed in one, I discover I've neglected another. It's a real pain. Not only that, but I strongly dislike C++.</p>

<p>Also, I've had to shelve some projects I would have enjoyed. If I had more time, I would code the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A Java applet (complete with AI player) for <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~yon/ai/assignments/as1.html">Black &amp; White</a>, a game I had to code (in C++) for a recent AI assignment. Apparently my cousin Corey visited my <q>web</q> and was disappointed; I figure putting a game on it would gain his interest. Language: Java.</li>
 <li>Integrating <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> with <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany">Epiphany</a>'s History and Bookmarks. It would give speedup and code cleanup. It would also make extensions easier to write and more powerful. Language: C.</li>
</ul>

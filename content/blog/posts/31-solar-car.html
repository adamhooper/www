<p>On Friday I looked out a window at work and saw a solar-powered car pulling into the parking lot. So I went to take a look. It was Stanford's solar car, which apparently is sponsored in part by Google. A few googlers (myself included) flocked to the car, and I ended up with <a href="http://www.adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Solar%20Car">a small solar-powered car photo album</a>.</p>
<p>The car is very cool. It won a race from Texas to Calgary. One of its creators was telling me that on the last day of the race they had made an oversight and forgot to turn on half of the solar array, meaning they were missing half of their power intake. They lost the 11-minute lead they had developed and ended up racing neck-and-neck through Calgary, pulling some dodgy moves to cut off the second-place car or to avoid being left behind at a light.</p>
<p>There were some other funny tricks, too. Apparently every night before the sun went down they'd lean the solar array up against the sun to recharge the batteries as much as possible. Ditto for early morning. And if the ground was concrete, they'd spray it with water to make it more reflective. While driving, they'd aim to position the car alongside white eighteen-wheelers so that the truck would reflect light into the solar cells. (Drafting wasn't allowed according to contest rules, but this was.)</p>

<p>The car can hit a peak of 75mph, but its best speed is around 45mph-50mph: at that speed the solar array can recharge the batteries at the same rate as the motor discharges them.</p>
<p>After snapping these pictures, I went back to work. Man, is Google ever cool.</p>

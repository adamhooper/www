<p>Sometimes stories aren't news, and sometimes we don't write them.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://hartwellsottawa.wordpress.com/2009/11/24/at-the-other-end-of-the-needle/">a
recent story</a>, I spent time in an H1N1 vaccination clinic in
Ottawa. Prior to opening hour, the nurses' supervisor gave a pep talk
“off the record.” (In this case, I can write that the meeting
took place but not what was said. This sort of ethical agreement is
important to journalists and their sources.)</p>
<p>I assure you: nothing damning happened. There was no talk of
covered-up vaccine-related deaths and they didn't discuss plans to
gain mind control over visitors by injecting surreptitious serums. It
was mere procedure: a few tips to make nurses' jobs easier.</p>

<p>Why the secrecy? Because the media (and, by extension, citizens
who listen) are deemed uppity: they assault the slightest mishap—an
allergic reaction, for instance—at reality's expense.</p>
<p>Consider two fictional headlines: “Everybody is healthy” and “Man gets
H1N1, blames vaccine.” The former is statistically closer to truth,
but the latter is more interesting, regardless of its significance.</p>
<p>Journalists tell stories, not truth. We hate spreading rumours,
but a job is a job: on those disastrous days when planes land,
politicians parlay and bridges bridge, we have to improvise.</p>

<p>Last week I tried to connect a fatal fire at a women's shelter to
a suspicious one at a women's boarding house, just because both
involved one gender. It's an engrossing but misleading story or it's
non-news. (As a moral compromise, <a href="http://hartwellsottawa.wordpress.com/2009/11/17/womens-rooming-house-in-repair-after-blaze/">I
discarded almost all my work</a>, paining my editors, my mark and my
mood.)</p>
<p>Which is better: public outcry over a near-certain non-issue, or
media silence around an unimportant but compelling story?</p>

<p>I'm back from Gulu now. I'm staying at Backpackers, a hostel on Mengo hill in Kampala, while I search for an apartment.</p>
<p>When I got into my room, I started friendly conversation with a traveller in a neighbouring bunk. Not surprisingly, he didn't know anything about Gulu. I immediately thought to myself, <em>you decide your level of involvement</em>.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, there is something in Gulu that I am missing today: one of the founders of <a href="http://www.guluwalk.com">Gulu Walk</a> is visiting. Gulu Walk was founded in 2005 by a pair of Canadians. Instead of sleeping in their beds at night, Adrian Bradbury and Kieran Hayward decided to walk 7.5km to Toronto's city hall, sleep for only four hours (due to time constraints), walk back to their homes, and continue with their normal lives. Jobs, social life, etc. They did this every night, for a month. They blogged about their experience, and raised a lot of awareness (and cash) which provides tremendous help to the children in Northern Uganda.</p>

<p>They will readily admit that they didn't have to worry about malaria. They didn't have to worry about food, clothing, or shoes. And most importantly, they had their safety nets, in the forms of money, family, and friends.</p>
<p>In my blog, I have barely <em>mentioned</em> the night commuters. That is because I get the feeling that some of my readers just don't want to hear about them. I will respect my readers' comfort and leave the topic undeveloped. But before I drop the subject, allow me to add a final word:</p>
<p>You decide your level of involvement. Let me throw in a link to <a href="http://google.com/search?q=night+commuters">the results of a Google Search for &quot;night commuters&quot;</a>. If you want to learn more, set yourself up with a spare hour and a box of Kleenex, and read through some of the search results. <em>The night commuters are the <em>lucky</em> ones!</em></p>

<p>Adrian Bradbury will be proud when he visits Gulu (and my friend Erin!) and sees the impact he has had there. In honour of everybody who has participated in a Gulu Walk, and to comfort my readers (some of whom have missed the entire <em>point</em> of my <q>Fun Facts</q>), this entry's <q>Fun Fact</q> will actually be <em>inspirational</em>:</p>
<p><b><i>Fun Fact</i></b>: On Saturday, October 21, 2006, GuluWalk day, over 30,000 people, in 82 cities and 15 countries, took to the streets to urge the world to support peace in northern Uganda. The event raised over $500,000 for programs for a generation of children left behind.</p>

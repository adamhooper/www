<p>Yes, it's another post about free food.</p>
<p>At Google, there are many places where the cooks personalize our food to our exact specifications. Some people here don't think too much of it, but I am very touched when the cook looks me in the eye and smiles and gives me something delicious. Sometimes the lines are long: I think 15 minutes is about the longest a line can get. Here are some of the personalized foods I have eaten or need to eat:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Personalized smoothies every morning: start with your choice of juice; they scoop in the exact ingredients you ask for; choose yoghourt and/or ice; choose fortifiers such as ginseng or bee pollen; enjoy.</li>
 <li>Personalized omelettes: fill up a little bowl with as many mushrooms, pieces of sausage, leaves of spinach, etc. as you want; cheese is optional; there's some other dimension of choice I haven't quite identified (the guy asks if I want regular and I say yes).</li>
 <li>Personalized eggs: one or two, cooked to your specifications.</li>
 <li>Personalized breakfast burritos: they're new, and it's in the same line as the omelettes; I imagine you're given the added choice of white or whole weat.</li>
 <li>Personalized sushi: while the cook was hand-rolling my piece of sushi, he told me that the sprouts were special radish-flavoured sprouts from Asia or something. (Okay, so I forget. You would too, if somebody was actually right in front of you rolling you a piece of sushi.)</li>
 <li>Personalized burritos: TBD.</li>
 <li>Personalized quesadillas: I can't wait to try these.</li>
 <li>Personalized ice cream: Okay, so it's about as personalized as at any Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream store. But it feels even more so. I think because it's free.</li>
 <li>Personalized salad: choose the ingredients; choose chicken or beef or tofu or naught; watch them toss it with loads of flair.</li>
 <li>Personalized [dish of the day]: In some cafes, you give them your plate and tell them which dish you want and they chop it up in front of you; just say when.</li>
 <li>Personalized emails: I even get my own email address!</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure I've forgotten some; maybe I'll add to the Comments section as they spring to mind.</p>

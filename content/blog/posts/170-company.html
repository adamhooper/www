<p>Kahama is a lost trade town: dustier and smaller than its lake-endowed northern neighbour Mwanza, its only assets are buried gold, a few hundred thousand residents and a dirt road that guides trucks from the rest of Tanzania to Rwanda. Google Maps shows it as a low-resolution swerve in the road. On the ground, it seems like every second building is a guest house.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have seen where this conversation was going, as I filled in my midrange hotel's registry:</p>
<p>"Company?" asked the landlady.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"No, I'm a student, I don't have a company," I replied.</p>
<p>"Company?" she asked again, watching my pen.</p>
<p>"Where do I write my company?" I queried, intending to jot down my school name.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Her patience was leaving. "You want company?"</p>
<p>"Ohhhhhhhhhhh. No, thank you."</p>

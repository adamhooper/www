<p>I spent five nights in Malawi. This was enough for me to make several oversimplified comparisons to Tanzania:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Local food: nsima and relish (same as ugali and mchicha in Tanzania).</li>
 <li>Local languages: many, with English the common tongue. As in other African countries, language barriers are probably still a contributing factor of tribalism and discrimination. Tanzania, with its near-universal Swahili, seems more cohesive.</li>
 <li>Roads: fantastic.</li>
 <li>Scenery: stupendous. Mountains tower above Lake Malawi from both sides, resulting in spectacular sunrises, sunsets, days, and nights.</li>
 <li>Backpacking: Malawi is a superb backpacking country. Rates are cheap, people speak English, roads are good.... If you want to visit Africa, Malawi is a great place to start.</li>
 <li>Business: it may just be a feeling, but I get the impression Malawi revolves around South Africa whereas Tanzania revolves around Kenya.</li>
 <li>Politics: when I left Malawi, parliament was dissolving. No difference from Tanzania there.</li>
 <li>In general: I would need to stay much longer to understand Malawi.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next up: Zambia and Victoria Falls.</p>

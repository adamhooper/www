<p>In the grocery store today, I found passion fruits! They were shrink-wrapped, but still they reminded me of East Africa. Naturally, I bought one.</p>
<p>At the checkout, the clerk hefts it up and down, searches it for a nonexistent label, and then stares at me blankly. I say it is a passion fruit. He stares at me, then the fruit, then me again. He says, lime? I say, passion fruit! and I point to his fruit price list. The fruit is not on the list. He runs over to his supervisor, who looks at it and tells him, with a better-than-thou, knowledgeable facial expression, that this is one of those <em>exotic</em> fruits. He asks how much it costs. Still trying to sound knowledgeable, she asks what I called it. I say, <em>passion fruit!</em> She runs over to the fruit and vegetable section to find the price. My clerk mutters about me and my bizarre fruits.</p>

<p>It cost me $1.99. Which is around 6632% more than I have ever paid for a passion fruit before. And it was sour. But it was worth it.</p>

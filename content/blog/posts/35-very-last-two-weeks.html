<p>As I am wont to do, I neglected to blog over the past two weeks of my internship. A Cole's Notes version follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Intern Cruise</b>: Google offered all its interns and their hosts a cruise in the San Francisco bay. Free. There are some pictures in <a href="http://adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Bay%20Cruise">my Bay Cruise photo album</a>. The neatest part (which I didn't manage to photograph) was that there were fireworks over the bay that night. I don't know why. They made for a spectacular view.</li>
 <li><b>Redwoods</b>: a few of us went to Muir Woods and saw the enormous trees. The <em>truly</em> enormous trees like to hang out farther north, but we were quite in awe of the enormity of these slightly less enormous trees nonetheless. See more in <a href="http://adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Muir%20Woods">my Muir Woods photo album</a>.</li>
 <li><b>Lombard Street</b>: On the way back from the redwoods, we drove up the scariest street ever. It's in San Francisco. It has to be experienced to be believed; the closest most of my readers will get, though, is by flipping through <a href="http://adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Lombard%20Street">my Lombard Street photo album</a>.</li>
 <li><b>Plane Ride</b>: Nothing to report. Immediately after dropping my luggage in my apartment, I went to an Irish pub. It didn't have a live DJ <em>or</em> a disco ball; instead, it had a live band and pleasant company. Canadian Irish pubs are better than Californian Irish pubs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am now home. Since I'm not in California any more, I don't have much to write on the topic. Thus ends a chapter in my life. Now's a good time to hit <q>pause</q> and grab a beer.</p>

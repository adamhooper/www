<p>Internet is very slow, so I won't bother trying to upload a load of pictures. Instead, I'll put three:</p>
<p><%= image_tag 'blog/uganda1.jpg' %><br/>Me with some important people in Makarere University</p>
<p><%= image_tag 'blog/uganda2.jpg' %><br/>St. Stephen's Hospital, from behind, while bouncing away on the bumpy dirt road</p>
<!--more-->
<p><%= image_tag 'blog/uganda3.jpg' %><br/>Kampala. I'm still bad at orientation, but I think this picture faces Mulago hill.</p>
<p>Today I visited St. Stephen's Hospital, which is very small but impressive nonetheless. I worked in the university a bit. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to contribute work which will be of use after I'm gone: it's by far my largest concern. I want to provide services which are not easy to come by (because I am capable), but if what I create would be unusable after I'm gone, then perhaps my best contribution would be to teach people how to make stuff bold in Word. I expect I will learn more in the days to come.</p>
<p>More stories will have to wait. I just wanted to get a few pictures back to those at home.</p>

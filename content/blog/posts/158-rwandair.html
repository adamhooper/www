<p>Everybody was somebody on today's RwandAir flight.</p>
<p>On the tarmac, I met a woman from the check-in counter: the same woman who sold me my ticket in downtown Dar es Salaam on Thursday.</p>
<p>The flight attendants appeared twice in the in-flight magazine. (I suppose most RwandAir staff are in the magazine, with the predictable exception of the white people in the cockpit.) It's the magazine's first and only issue, in RwandAir's first and only airplane, a fifty-seater made by Quebec-based Bombardier.</p>

<p>In front of me, a journalist who studied in Kigali under Allan Thompson, the same Ottawa-based professor who coordinated the Rwanda News Agency internship I'll be learning from for the next two months.</p>
<p>Beside him, a journalist who will be working with one of my new roommates.</p>
<p>And all around us, Rwanda's national football team, <em>Amavubi</em> (The Wasps), in matching black-and-white track gear. They stunned Tanzania's <em>Taifa Stars</em> yesterday with a 1-1 tie in Dar es Salaam, setting up a revenge match for early June in Kigali.</p>

<p>"Everywhere, I score," explained Roger Tchouassi, who got the goal. "Even on this plane, I score."</p>
<p>As for me: well, people were asking for my contact details. I must be somebody important, too.</p>

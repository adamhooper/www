<p>First of all, let me apologize for not bringing my camera along on Sunday. I missed it the entire time. I'm sorry, camera!</p>
<p>A few of us headed down to Monterey to visit the <a href="http://www.mbayaq.org/">Monterey Bay Aquarium</a>, which has lots and lots of fish and stuff. When we got to Monterey we found it to be much too busy and we couldn't park. So we decided to go to a town called Carmel-by-the-Sea instead.</p>
<p>Carmel-by-the-Sea has tons of boutiques. It's a tourist town, but there's not really much to recommend it... except that <em>Clint Eastwood used to be mayor</em>! We walked around and found a really cool restaurant called <q>Forge in the Forest</q> which looked like it was run by dwarves (there were fires and forge paraphernalia abound). Then we went to the <q>Eastwood Mission Ranch</q>, where we found no signs of Clint Eastwood at all. And the ranch looked over the ocean, in what seemed to me to be an un-ranch-like manner. It would have been boring, except the name Eastwood was in its title and that saved the day.</p>

<p>We headed back to Monterey, parked in a garage, and took the free trolley to the aquarium. The aquarium had all sorts of big and small fish. The sea otters were floppy and fantastic, and the tuna were incredibly speedy. The pengiuns were a little boring (but <em>so</em> cute). All in all, the aquarium was fantastic.</p>
<p>We meant to see redwoods on the way home, but we stayed at the aquarium too long so we didn't get a chance.</p>

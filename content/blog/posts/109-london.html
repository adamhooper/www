<p>MONDAY</p>
<ul>
<li>
Most of today I spent without a map or even the Tube. I just... walked. And it
was awesome. I started by crossing London Bridge (which, thankfully, wasn't
falling down). Before I knew it, I was at The Monument, and there were signs
pointing to London Tower. I went on the beefeater tour (which was awesome),
stared at the insane crown jewels, and explored the White Tower.</li>
<li>Then I meandered over to St. Paul's Cathedral. All I can say is, wow. At risk of
sounding like a hippie: that place has an amazing energy. (It makes me really
keen to see the Sistene Chapel, to tell the truth....) The Whispering Dome
thing was very cool; I found the sheer size and detail of the construction far
more impressive than the fact that you can whisper to someone on the other
side. I went up to the top, which was very cool... but the dome was the coolest
part. After, I went down to the ground floor and listened to a choir practice
(while staring up at the awesomeness of the dome some more). I meandered
through the crypt, as well, but I didn't pay attention.</li>
<li>Then I walked across the Millenium Bridge and proceeded down the south side of
the Thames all the way to Westminster bridge (which I crossed). The bridge
itself is undergoing renovations, which removed some of the view of Parliament,
but I saw plenty from the south side of the Thames.</li>
</ul>
<p>TUESDAY</p>
<ul>
<li>St. James Park, Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens: while waiting for the
Changing of the Guards, I went a-walkin'. It was very pretty. There's
a gimmick statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, which made me
feel tourist-y. I was impressed, though, with how closely the real
Kensington Gardens matched the picture I imagined while reading the
original Peter Pan.</li>
<li>Changing of the Guard: I am a tourist. Crammed in with other
tourists. A bunch of people in fluffy (and Canadian!) hats play five
Andrew Lloyd Weber songs, Abba, and a few more bouncy tunes. All
rather silly, ceremonial, and fun.</li>
<li>Westminster Abbey: beautiful! I particularly loved Poets' Corner.
While exploring, a priest noticed the flag on my backpack and pointed
out to me a plaque commemorating John A. Macdonald. How cool! I'm glad
I have a flag of Canada on my backpack! (Yes, that is a thank-you to
those responsible.)</li>
<li>Science Museum: this place is truly awesome. There was a special
exhibit on the history of the steam engine (of which the English were
pretty much the sole contributors). There was also a long, wide
passage which let you "walk through time": starting at around 1700,
and walking forward into the present: every few feet, a few new items.
Also, there was a complete Difference Engine! (The Difference Engine
was a gargantuan predecessor to the modern concept of a computer. It
was never completed, but the people at the Science Museum used
Babbage's original design schematics, overcame hurdles, and built the
entire thing. About 100 years after the fact. It's huge, and it
works!)</li>
<li>Leicester Square (or, as I had written on my to-visit list, "Lester
Square"): Very cool. I particularly love how the movie theatres are
fashioned after real theatres: each theatre only displays one movie,
the outside plastered with critics' acclaim. Of course, the sheer
quantity of real theatre in the area makes it rather undesireable to
watch a movie.</li>
<li>History Boys: A beautiful play. I got tickets last-minute and
thoroughly enjoyed it. On three sides, I was surrounded by a flock of
Californian students who were studying for a semester in London. They
were all studying theatre. They were most impressed with how watching
the play goes so much faster than reading the script. Personally, I
was more interested in the theme of differing approaches to taboo
subjects (illustrated most clearly by the Holocaust discussion, with
several allusions scattered throughout the rest of the play). But hey,
whatever floats your boat. (And to think: in an alternate reality I'd
have moved to California by now. Sheesh.)</li>
</ul>
<p>WEDNESDAY</p>
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>British Museum: Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Egypt, big pieces of Parthenon,
and the Rosetta Stone. And so much more. I spent all day in here.</li>
<li>Covent Garden: After the British Museum, I wandered through Covent
Garden. I was particularly entertained by some street musicians who
were following pedestrians while playing Canon in D on their violins.</li>
<li>Trafalgar Square: a beautiful place. They have a Uganda House there.
And a Canada House. They aren't embassies... I don't quite know what
they are.</li>
<li>Antony and Cleopatra: I wandered down Strand and came across a
theatre which was home to a performance of Antony and Cleopatra. So I
got a rush ticket. It just happened to be in the front row. I could
see the sweat on Patrick Stewart's forehead! His performance was
spectacular. And he was almost overshadowed by the absolutely perfect
performance of Cleopatra (I don't know the actress). It was, I think,
the best Shakespeare performance I've ever seen.</li>
</ul>
<p>THURSDAY</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural History Museum: I had wanted to visit this after the Science
Museum on Tuesday, but I hadn't had the time. On Thursday I didn't
quite have the time either, but I made a hasty tour through the
dinosaurs and mammals. I missed Darwin's collections.</li>
<li>Regent's Park: Big park. BIG park. Very pretty. I only spent about
10 minutes here.</li>
<li>(meet Nancy and Stuart here)</li>
<li>Pub for lunch! With a pint! Whee!</li>
<li>National Gallery: a hasty perusal while Stuart was on the phone. At
this point, I begin to get the feeling I could stay in London forever
and never see all the art.</li>
<li>St. Martin in the Fields: a beautiful church. Somebody was
practising Vivaldi on violin while we visited.</li>
<li>The Man of Mode: a National Theatre comedy: a recreation of a
17th-century comedy about a very promiscuous ladies' man. Amazing how
well it translates to today. (And of course, that's sort of the whole
point of the production....)</li>
</ul>
<p>FRIDAY</p>
<ul>
<li>The Tate Modern collection: we spent a couple of hours in the Tate
Modern, which is a converted power plant. The surrealist exhibit we
saw was very impressive. My favourite piece was a set of five
photographs with various people in London holding up signs bearing
"what they want to say, not what we want them to say" (e.g., a
businessman holding up a sign saying "I'm depressed"). Apparently the
subjects picked the words and posed with them voluntarily.</li>
<li>Greenwich Village: we took the boat down to Greenwich Village. It's
a bit tourist-y, but this was offset by the relative lack of tourists
(it being winter).</li>
<li>Royal Observatory: I now have a picture of myself straddling the
prime meridian. All of Harrison's important clocks are here, too. I
loved it all.</li>
<li>Painted Hall: it's a hall with paintings on the ceiling and walls.
Very pretty.</li>
<li>Picadilly Circus: ooh, fun. Big and shiny.</li>
<li>The 39 Steps: a hilarious comedy with four actors. A great way to end the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tomorrow I'll have enough time to visit The Globe, hopefully meander a
bit, and then catch my plane to an entirely different world.</p>

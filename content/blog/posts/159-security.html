<p>I must have been asked the question a thousand times, but I never know how to answer.</p>
<p>"How do you find Rwanda compares with other countries in East Africa?"</p>

<p>Luckily, this time around I could turn the question back on its asker. Our night guard, Moses, was born in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and has lived in western Tanzania as well. He settled halfway between in his fatherland, Rwanda, after the war in 1994.</p>
<p>He answered like a teacher explaining to a student. "Here in Rwanda, it's very secure."</p>
<p>So far, I've carried stacks of money downtown, stumbled up the dark roads near home at night, and even deployed my camera, complete with tripod, after sundown on the silent streets outside our home. Two days into my stay in this plush Kigali neighbourhood, I have no reason to disagree.</p>

<p><i>Challenge: put a capital I in every sentence.</i></p>
<p>It is about time to explain my job in Tanzania.</p>
<p>I work for an organization called Femina HIP.  Femina HIP is a rather famous media company which spreads information about sexuality and HIV/AIDS. It runs a television talk show, a radio show, periodicals, and several one-off publications. Distributing all these media requires a fairly well-organized system; and that is  where I fit in.</p>

<p>The system I am to replace is an ad-hoc collection of Excel spreadsheets and binders full of handwritten paperwork. I will be organizing various aspects of Femina's internal workings: essentially, I will integrate various Excel spreadsheets into a comprehensive database.</p>
<p>Integration, if implemented properly, will provide many benefits: fewer errors, better projections, better M&amp;E (monitoring and evaluation), better communication, and so on. Femina HIP already has most of the infrastructure ready for me to work. I am hoping to finish implementing my first component in time for the distribution of the newest issue of Si Mchezo! magazine next week.</p>
<p>I also have plenty of secondary responsibilities to fill in the cracks: training, consulting, and troubleshooting, to name a few. In the end, there will be plenty of work for my remaining five months in Dar es Salaam. Hopefully, by the time I leave, Femina HIP should be ready to grow its image even more.</p>

<p><i>Challenge: write exactly two sentences in each paragraph.</i></p>
<p>I have recently advertised this blog to many new recipients. In this post, I will introduce myself: in particular, my pre-Tanzania self as it relates to this blog.</p>
<p>I have a few abilities: I learn quickly and I pride myself on having a wide-open mind. On the negative side, I am overly proud and I have not yet learned to pick my battles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I grew up around and in Montreal and I have a degree in Software Engineering. The <q>rich engineer</q> career path is certainly open to me.</p>
<p>After university, I decided to change tack. I spent three months in Uganda learning more about the world and myself than I ever imagined possible.</p>
<p>In those three months, I lived in Kampala and I explored the rest of Uganda (including the north, home to a 20-year-old civil war). I also journeyed through Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, and Western Europe (yes, there was a bit of culture shock).</p>

<p>At the end of May I came home, where everything seems... unreal. I immediately set out to return to Africa as some sort of aid worker: a lifestyle I dream of almost every night.</p>
<p>Soon after making this decision, I was found by an organization called VSO Canada. VSO matches <q>skilled</q> Canadians to overseas organizations; to help the cause, please donate generously at <a href="http://vsocan.org/donate">http://vsocan.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>(I must mention an aside here: the views expressed on this blog are mine alone and do not represent the views of VSO Canada. Barring strange coincidences, of course.)</p>

<p>On August 8th, I will be travelling to Tanzania. I will be living in Dar es Salaam for six months.</p>
<p>I will be working for an organization called Femina HIP. Femina distributes publications about AIDS across the country, and it is high time a database be designed to make matters easier.</p>
<p>This blog will chronicle the experiences which I think my readers will find interesting. I have little faith in my ability to transfer ideas through a blog; and so I make little <q>challenges</q> on each blog entry to highlight my view that blogging is a woefully constricted art form.</p>

<p>Welcome to my world. You may visit a few times a week; I live here 24/7.</p>

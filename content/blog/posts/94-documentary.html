<p>I had never thought about the role of a documentary filmmaker before coming to Uganda. It seems quite obvious now that the final cut doesn't even convey a <em>fraction</em> of the available footage, knowledge, or emotion.</p>
<p>Last night I watched <a href="http://www.invisiblechildren.com">Invisible Children</a>, a documentary about the night commuters. What was going through these documentary makers' minds when they made their film (and <q>Movement</q>)? Their goal, I imagine, was to invoke a sense of need and urgency, without making people feel <em>too</em> helpless.</p>
<p>Invisible Children shows one <em>miniscule</em> piece of a much larger story. It presents <em>no</em> facts, and I'm almost certain the documentary filmmakers cut out their most terrifying footage: relatively speaking, the worst stuff in that movie ain't all that bad. (You know, that scene of raw emotion, flashing scene after scene of horror). I've seen worse on the main streets of Kampala. The movie does not blame anybody for the war; it does not describe the LRA; it does not describe the Acholi; it does not present any stakeholders besides the night commuters; simply put, it does not present any explanations of anything.</p>

<p>What the movie <em>does</em> present is a movement of which one may easily become a part. It does this by presenting a miniscule subset of information about the situation in northern Uganda. There is more on the website; but even this paints extremely broad strokes. The website focuses on how to contribute, not your contribution's effects. I'd go as far as to say the website focuses on America, not Uganda.</p>
<p>Is that such a bad thing? I don't know all the information about northern Uganda. As I've mentioned recently, <em>nobody does</em>. A film should have a message, and Invisible Children does. A film should play to emotions, and Invisible Children does. The film presents very little <em>incorrect</em> information, by simply presenting <em>no</em> information. Maybe too much information would be too discouraging? Maybe it would warrant an R rating, excluding a very impressionable fraction of its audience?</p>
<p>You may notice that <em>I</em> have not presented any information about northern Uganda on my blog, either, perhaps for those exact same reasons. My blog focuses on <em>ideas</em>, not information. Because if I just wrote raw information, well... you've got better things to do than read that. And I don't want to offend anybody.</p>

<p>I can't help but compare myself with the documentary makers. Consider this post my interlude: that relatively tame ten minutes in the middle of the film where you allow yourself to remember that it's just a movie. You've seen all this information already: it's just presented a bit differently. Meanwhile, I'm trying to figure out how to get my message across.</p>
<p>You can tell I'm a rookie.</p>

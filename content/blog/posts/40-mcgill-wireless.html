<p>At <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca">McGill</a>, our wireless network requires a web-based log-in. That is, the first web request results in an authentication web page being presented to the user. After the user types in a valid username and password, some voodoo is performed, and an <q>authentication succeeded</q> page is displayed.</p>
<p>There are two enormous annoyances:</p>
<ul>
 <li>No Internet is available over any port until the web page has been visited. I'm constantly frustrated: email, VNC, ssh... none work. I haven't looked into how feasible it is to write an <code>if-up.d</code> script to automate the log-in.</li>
 <li>After typing in a web page and hitting Enter, the authentication web page intercepts; the original web page the user typed in is never presented. This is especially annoying because the URL of the <q>authentication succeeded</q> page <em>actually contains the originally-typed web page</em> as a <code>GET</code> parameter. Why don't they just use a simple HTTP redirect and save thounsands of students the trouble?</li>
</ul>
<p>One day a flash hit me, and I realized I could solve the second problem (which I'll admit only exists because of the first, which is still annoying) in ten minutes, using an Epiphany extension. It had been a shameful while since I'd last written one, but my <code>sample-python-location.py</code> example was extremely close to what I wanted.</p>

<p>I just created the following in my <code>~/.gnome2/epiphany/extensions</code>, and enabled the extension through the extensions manager:</p>
<p><b><code>redirect-mcgill-wireless.py</code></b>:</p>
<pre><![CDATA[#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# Listens to location changes using Python

import epiphany

import re

def location_cb(embed, address):
        m = re.match('http://wireless-login.mcgill.ca/wireless/webpages/welcome.php?.*original_url=(.*)', address)
        if m:
                embed.load_url(m.group(1))

def attach_tab(window, tab):
        embed = tab.get_embed()
        sig = embed.connect('ge-location', location_cb)
        embed._python_sample_location_sig = sig

def detach_tab(window, tab):
        embed = tab.get_embed()
        sig = embed._python_sample_location_sig
        del embed._python_sample_location_sig
        embed.disconnect(sig)]]></pre>

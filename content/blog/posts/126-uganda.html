<p>My next destination is the lovely country of Uganda. I will be staying in the capital, Kampala. My vague ambition is to help out with my computer skills while taking in the sights and gaining a new appreciation for life.</p>
<p>You can keep up with my adventures on my blog. I'll be starting off by spending most of next week in London. After that, I plan on living the next three months in Uganda. After <em>that</em>, maybe some backpacking through Europe. And after <em>that</em>, well... I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise, would I?</p>

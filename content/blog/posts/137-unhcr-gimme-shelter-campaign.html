<p>This story has hit all major news websites, but I want to plug it here, too: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXmxTJnKDM8">Ben Affleck's five-minute film about the UNHCR in Eastern Congo</a>. (UNHCR means United Nation High Commission for Refugees: the agency that sets up refugee camps.)</p>
<p>The film has smiling people, which constantly awes me when I witness poverty, and which Ben Affleck deliberately wanted to demonstrate: <em>these are real people</em>. Hats off for an unconventional and powerful approach to the genre.</p>
<p>(The documentary cleverly omits the part of the story where the UNHCR sheltered the army of genocidaires largely responsible for starting this conflict, back in 1994; but it also refrains from reminding us that we the Western people spent decades hurling causes of war into the region, so I suppose both oversights cancel each other out.)</p>

<p>Again, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXmxTJnKDM8">watch this five-minute film about an entire people's way of life</a>. It should help put our own economic crises into perspective.</p>

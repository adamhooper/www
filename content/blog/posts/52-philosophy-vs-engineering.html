<p>In my first Philosophy conference, we were asked to state our name, program, and reason for taking the course. After going about halfway around the room, the spotlight fell on the person next to me, who said she was in Chemical Engineering and was taking Philosophy because she was afraid Engineering is making her a robot.</p><p>
My turn came right after that. I had prepared some drivel about improving my methods of reasoning. But I thought about it for one more second, and then I said, "same reason."</p>

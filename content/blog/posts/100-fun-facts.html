<p>I will be in Gulu for the next week. Somehow the idea has entered my mind to add a little gimmick to my blog: <q>Fun Facts</q>. For the next few entries (or, potentially, for the rest of my visit to Uganda), I will append a <q>Fun Fact</q> to the end of each blog entry.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise awareness back home. In fact, last night (which I spent alone, so I could recuperate from a mild cold) I had a lot of ideas about which directions my blog should take. It's quite clear in my mind that I can't just write stuff like <q>I went to a camp in Gulu and took pictures of children</q>. That carefree, happy-go-lucky form of blogging would connote the exact opposite of the situation here.</p>
<p>Since I'll be up in Gulu, my first few <q>Fun Facts</q> will be Gulu-inspired. I hope my readers enjoy them.</p>

<p><b><i>Fun Fact</i></b>: In and around northern Uganda, two million civilians have been displaced by the LRA, which is estimated to have fewer than two thousand combatants. That's one thousand civilians per rebel!</p>

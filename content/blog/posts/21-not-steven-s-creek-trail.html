<p>Shortly after I posted my original post about <a href="http://www.adamhooper.com/blog/California/Steven_s_Creek_Trail.adam">Steven's Creek Trail</a>, I was informed of another path from NASA Ames to the Googleplex. It involves turning right directly after leaving NASA Ames, and then crossing The Stupidest Piece of Water Ever <em>north</em> of where the original path diverged from the trail.</p>
<p>The path is about 0.2 miles shorter than Steven's Creek Trail (3.05 miles instead of 3.25). Many people I've talked with prefer it because crossing the 101 is allegedly a bit of a chore. Personally, I find the dirt path in this trail more of a pain, but that's because my bike isn't made for dirt. It <em>is</em> nice that this new trail avoids traffic even more than the previous trail.</p>
<p>I have again described the trail as a photo album, and there are some goodies in there for people who like spying on NASA. So here it is: <a href="http://www.adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Not%20Steven's%20Creek%20Trail">my photo gallery of the trail that is not Steven's Creek Trail</a>.</p>

<p>One of my pictures shows the remnants of SGI. I'll explain a bit about SGI, because it's funny. In a mean sort of way.</p>
<p>SGI was a big tech company that decided enormous, expensive computers were the way to go for 3D graphics (as opposed to small, cheap ones). SGI's potential customers were evidently unconvinced. SGI now faces bankruptcy, whereas Google is prospering. That just goes to show, the customer is always right. And if the customer is wrong, then so are you.</p>
<p>There are three potential lessons to be learned from SGI's mistakes, and I'm not quite sure which one is correct:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Listen to your cutomers. (If you can't find any customers, then try to guess what your competitors' customers might be saying.)</li>
 <li>If you find you have chosen the wrong corporate strategy, change it and direct your expertise towards more profitable ventures.</li>
 <li>Don't be SGI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometime around 2004, Google moved into all of SGI's buildings. SGI retreated into <a href="http://www.adamhooper.com/photos/?galerie=Not%20Steven's%20Creek%20Trail&amp;photo=17">a new, nearby building</a> to await its destiny, which will probably arrive this year.</p>
<p>I'm struck by a sudden thought: my little history lesson is quite a contrast to the blog entries I've been reading recently about <a href="http://caitlin-inthedr.blogspot.com/2006/05/beach.html">dumb people in charge making stupid decisions <em>which affect real people</em></a>. I mean, when all is said and done, who cares about some stupid tech company?</p>

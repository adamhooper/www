<p>After a night out with the Concordia bunch I mentioned in a previous blog entry, I got a ride home. The power was out (at the guest house, there is a generator; but they don't turn it on after midnight), and so it was very dark. As I approached my door, I saw a cat. (There is a cat on the premises, known as Jinja.) So, of course, I said: <q>Hi, Jinja</q>!</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a rat. So I said: <q>Oh, you're not Jinja. Well, I'm going to open the door now, and you're blocking it, so I hope you don't bite me.</q></p>
<p>And I did, and it didn't.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes later did I register my utter lack of fear, disgust, and even surprise. That rat was big enough to <em>eat</em> Jinja, and I was entirely unfazed.</p>

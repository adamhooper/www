<p>This particular California blog is sort of new to me: I'm actually blogging about my personal life. Well, I suppose it had to happen sometime.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this entry I'll dispense with words like &quot;yesterday&quot;, which for obvious reasons are overly complicated.</p>
<p>Also, this entry is excessively long so that Mom won't ask me endless questions.</p>

<p>Wednesday: had a great time with my friends at McKibbins and Brutopia. Thank you for coming, Lisa, Beth, Jen, Sam, Marc, Rob, Raph, Caitlin, Gen, and Jesse. (&quot;The Other Jesse&quot; will henceforth be referred to as &quot;Jesse S&quot;. Sorry you couldn't make it, Jesse S.)</p>
<p>Thursday: woke up with a <em>killer</em> sore throat, which faded by noon to a rather tame one. Had a great time with Rachel. Saw Dad, Kate, Jesse, and Mike at Hurley's. Made hotel reservations online, reserved a taxi. By the time Rachel left, I technically found myself in Friday.</p>
<p>Friday: you can do a heck of a lot when you count days as 24-hour chunks. I started off with laundry, made some coffee, and packed. Luckily my apartment is small; after seeing the disaster in the country clearing out Gran's and Dave's houses, my apartment is a relief. In the bathroom, I just emptied the medicine cabinet into a plasic bag. In the kitchen, I just ate everything in the fridge. In my bedroom and living room, I stood in the middle and turned in circles until I couldn't see anything left to pack.</p>

<p>3:00am: Went outside with my luggage. I had planned to go outside 5 minutes early to catch some fresh air; as I walked out the door the taxi driver came. Cool. He turned out to be an electrical engineer who was laid off, and he complained to me about discrimination. He though I was a bit crazy to be going to the airport so soon.</p>
<p>At the airport: first of all, I found out that the Expedia receipt, despite the website's protests, is <em>not</em> enough to get tickets: I also need to know which airline I'm flying with (which is not printed on the receipt). I had to whip out my laptop and use the Internet (cost: $5) to view my information online. The logo next to my flight was an Air Canada one, but the flight was &quot;provided by&quot; United Express <em>and</em> Shuttle something-or-other, somehow. I chose the United Express check-in line, even though the flight number on Expedia's wesite was an Air Canada one. I was about 5th in line and the line hadn't started moving yet, so I copied the rest of the passengers and stole a customs information form from the desk and filled it out. The line moved (very slowly) and I was relieved to discover it was the correct one. I then found myself in the enormous customs line. As Flis suggested, I checked that my luggage was tagged correctly.</p>
<p>4:30am: The customs line was huge. It kept moving, so I couldn't play video games. I had no idea what I was supposed to <em>do</em> once I actually got to the counter, but I figured I'd worry about that when the time came. It came and I found myself with an extremely rude customs officer. I was friendly and acted clueless and said I needed a J-1 visa. He was rude: he gave me a form and told me to go &quot;over there&quot; to fill it out, then come back to a different desk. I did, and the person at the different desk was pleasant.</p>

<p>5:00am: Dropped off my luggage. Realized immediately after that my Swiss Army knife wasn't going to fly, literally. I use that thing every day, dammit. Still, I guess I had to forget <em>something</em> in my sick/exhausted state.</p>
<p>The plane from Montreal to Chicago was nice. I had a window seat, but it was raining in Chicago and I saw nothing. The airport is <em>really</em> cool there, and I spent a while wandering around aimlessly, trying to avoid spending lots of money on food. I finished Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, ate pizza at a place which looked good but tasted bad, and boarded my flight to San Jose. I was miffed at not getting a window seat. The guy next to me didn't want to trade, so boo.</p>
<p>10:00am: I'd been awake roughly 24 hours at this point. The flight lasted forever and I could barely sleep (if only I'd had a window to lean against!). My sore throat was annoying me (I could never drink enough), so I chewed through my pack of gum on the trip. I watched Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (the in-flight movie looked absolutely horrible: some Wind in the Willows knock-off written, directed, and animated by a first-year computer graphics student?). I read some Neil Gaiman and tried to sleep, but neither went over very well. Just as I was breaking out the video games (&quot;ultimate boredom&quot;), we were told to disable electronic equipment because we'd be landing soon. Woo-hoo!</p>

<p>12:30pm: After so many hours, morning is just barely over! San Jose's airport is miniscule. I picked up my luggage, got my car (unpleasant surprise: Google said that the corporate discount would bypass the $50 under-25-years-old fee; it didn't). A Chevrolet compact. Then I drove around Mountain View, trying to get a feel for the city. It's larger than I expected. Also less... mountain-y. I think I saw a hill in the distance as I was driving down one street. Most streets are 4-lane at least (many are 4- or 5-lane in both directions). One-way streets are extremely rare. There are huge trees everywhere. There are no skyscrapers; still, the street layout makes Montreal seem somewhat quaint in comparison. Google's collection of buildings is massive: the campus must be a bit larger than McGill (I'll know better once I've been inside).</p>
<p>I checked in to my hotel, then walked along &quot;downtown&quot; (Castro Street: practically the only one-lane street in the city) looking for a place to eat. I was happy to notice at least one Irish pub. I ate, then headed home (I was too tired to execute my plan of getting a bank account).</p>
<p>6:00pm: I was disappointed to discover that the 20 channels in my hotel room don't include the San Jose hockey match. They do basketball instead. I watched that for 10 minutes (flipping constantly for a hint of hockey). By 6:30 I was asleep. Apart from a coughing fit around 7:30, I slept like a baby until 8:30.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>And luckily, that's 8:30am (as opposed to pm: I wasn't sure). I found an internet cable in my apartment and I've since been setting myself up electronically. Now, my plan is to go out and not come back until I have an apartment and a bike (and maybe a new cell phone plan).</p>
<p>So far, I have seen nothing but beautiful weather in Mountain View. The temperature is just right, and in my experience the sun is always up. I am comfortable and almost completely healthy, and I'm looking forward to my day. Maybe I'll get the bike first; I'd love to bike around a lot.</p>
<p>Odd differences between Mountain View and Montreal:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Culture: mostly Mexican and American; I haven't noticed any, say, Chinese.</li>
 <li>Accents: as expected, the accent will take some getting used to and until then I find it awfully amusing.</li>
 <li>Smoking: since landing, I saw one cigarette total.</li>

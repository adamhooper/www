<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://graphnews.ca">Graph Newsmagazine</a>, we green Carleton journalism students have launched two new sites in a class project: <a href="http://hartwellsottawa.wordpress.com">Hartwells</a> and <a href="http://ottawaoffcentre.wordpress.com">Ottawa Off-Centre</a>. I am a part of the Hartwells team; our two sites are not competitive. Both websites are updated frequently on Tuesdays.</p>

<p>Hartwells is different from Graph News: while Graph News is run by students who aim to maintain it over the entirety of our two-year program, Hartwells will probably only last until the end of this semester. Its transience should by no means imply that it is not of the highest quality: already Hartwells showcases some fantastic journalism.</p>

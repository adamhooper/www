<p><i>Challenge: delve into poverty: explain what I mean without (any
mention of) money.</i></p>
<p>There is nothing magical about Africa.</p>
<p>Geldof may say there is. When I tell people at home that I am
going to Africa, their eyes light up and they ask for details. I have
met countless people in Africa—expatriates and Africans alike—who
have said the same thing: life in the West is just... different
somehow. Worse.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>But here I go, the eternal cynic, with another attempt at
myth-busting. (<a href="http://adamhooper.com/blog/Uganda/Ignorance">My first such blog entry</a> was, happily, quite
controversial.)</p>
<p>I will begin with something magical: the dala-dala. In Tanzania, a
swarm of people waits at a bus stand for the appropriate dala-dala to
appear. Once it arrives, a mad scramble ensues, after which the
dala-dala, loaded to the brim, careens on its way. The door sometimes
falls off; seats sometimes break apart; the dala-dala sometimes goes
to the wrong place; people are sometimes squished too tightly to
breathe, random arguments sometimes arise, and sometimes the whole
dala-dala simply breaks down and must be pushed. (Yes, I have
personally experienced all of these adventures.) In the end,
inexplicably, one exits at the appropriate destination. I often
imagine an American mechanic inspecting a typical dala-dala in
detail, turning to me, and declaring, <q>it is a provable physical
impossibility that this thing even moves.</q></p>
<p>If nobody can explain how it gets me from point A to point B, does
that make the dala-dala magical? More to the point, if nobody can
explain how it works, does that make the dala-dala <i>enjoyable</i>?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Actually, yes. The dala-dala, to me, is both magical and
enjoyable. Somehow, in spite of themselves, the dala-dalas work.
Every ride is a tiny miracle.</p>
<p>Now, how about another parallel, magical topic: life. I can (and
do) live without a shower, running water, a sit-down toilet, food or
drinking water while the sun is up (during Ramadan), efficient public
transit, a night life, and privacy. My relative poverty is truly
enjoyable. It is amazing how many aspects of life are, when you get
right down to it, optional.</p>
<p>I have yet to live without an aspect of life which is essential
for my survival. And so, using my good friend, induction (which I
have mentioned in <a href="http://adamhooper.com/blog/Tanzania/Induction">a previous blog entry</a>), shall I conclude that <i>all</i>
aspects of life are optional?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>No: I can <i>feel</i> like all aspects of life are optional, but
that does not make it so. Intuition alone can be misleading, and so
facts are necessary.</p>
<p>In <i>fact</i>, some aspects of life are essential. Food is
essential. Clean water is essential. Sanitation is essential. Shelter
is essential. Health is essential. Basic education is essential. Most
Tanzanians do not have all of these things which are <i>not</i>
optional for survival. Consequently, many die. As for most of the
living: like the American mechanic inspecting a dala-dala and
declaring that by all accounts it should be in a scrapyard, I can
imagine an American doctor would probably look at a random
Tanzanian's life history and conclude that this living, breathing
person has somehow died at least three times already.</p>
<p>If statistics can barely explain how people are surviving, does
that make their lives magical?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Learn a bit of Swahili, and suddenly many Tanzanians will open up
to you. Last Thursday night, I talked with a man my age, Michael, on
the streets in the city centre. He used to sell onions in Dar es
Salaam, and yet six months ago he was forced to stop. He became (I
discovered after an hour-long conversation) a beggar. Unlike most
Tanzanians, Michael probably possesses all the above-mentioned
necessities of life. Thus, in the Tanzanian luck-o-meter, a beggar
hovers well above the halfway point.</p>
<p>I mention this one story, not because it exemplifies Tanzanians in
general: I mention it because I wonder <i>who</i> claims that life is
magical in Africa. None of
the people I have heard claim life in Africa is magical (not even
Geldof) have lived through the kind of suffering which is normal in
Africa. Unsurprisingly, those I have talked to who are less fortunate
(and more common) have complained to me. Many have implied that they
would prefer a life in Canada to the lives they lead now. Guess what?
So would I.</p>
<p>So why do people suggest life is magical in Africa?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Maybe I should point out that most expatriates would never walk
down the reasonably safe street of Dar es Salaam at night as I did,
purely because of fear. I would not have been able to talk with
Michael if I locked myself into a room or a restaurant every night.
Should I have stayed home and pretended Michael does not exist? I
wonder how people honestly think they speak <i>for</i> people without
speaking <i>to</i> them first.</p>
<p>Yes, the people I have met in Africa are beautiful and
fascinating. Yes, they are welcoming. Yes, I appreciate their
excessively friendly culture. But no, I do not consider any of this
magical. <q>Magic</q>, in my estimation, is a word one throws into a
conversation to sound knowledgeable about something one does not
understand. Human beings have used the concept for millennia, and in
every case the term has died out once somebody provided a reasonable
explanation.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, I will probably get into a dala-dala accident.
When that happens, I will not consider the dala-dala magical any
more.</p>

<p>I am busy rebuilding my website. The new version is better. It is built using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, which deserves a plug. The hacker in me couldn&#8217;t resist writing a blog engine from scratch.</p> <p>Don&#8217;t mind the mess. Not all links behave as they ought to, and I will be putting more content in soon. I figure a website like this is better than one of those animated &#8220;Under Construction&#8221; websites from the 1990&#8217;s.</p>

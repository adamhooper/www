<p>Montreal and Dar es Salaam share a love of sport.</p>
<p>Sunday I took a bus around 2 p.m., before the soccer game between Simba and Yanga. The traffic was intense, to say the least.</p>
<p>On another bus around 6 p.m., the radio broadcast the end of the match. All of a sudden, "GOAL!" and Simba took the lead. The bus erupted in cheers and claps.</p>

<p>People high-fived me as I walked down the street.</p>
<p>Everybody was talking about it. Green-and-yellow flags waved out of car windows. Occasionally, crowds would spontaneously whistle and passing cars  would honk their horns.</p>
<p>And finally, as I neared home, a small flat-bed truck drove past carrying several people. They shouted and their contagious chant leapt to the pedestrians around me. Amid honks and hollers, the message was clear: <em>Olé, olé olé olé, olé, olé.</em></p>

<p>Montreal, I wish you the same glory this week.</p>

<p>Some things are so easy to get used to, I've practically forgotten them already:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cold showers (or on a good day, wildly-varying-temperature showers)</li>
 <li>Bugs (though I haven't had a cockroach in my room yet)</li>
 <li>The smell</li>
 <li>New food</li>
 <li>Boiling or buying water</li>
 <li>Crossing the street through terrifying traffic</li>
 <li>Saying a friendly hello to a guard walking down the street with an AK-47 in his hand</li>
 <li>Haggling for a better deal on just about every purchase</li>
 <li>Tipping more frugally (and often not at all)</li>
 <li>Frequent power outages</li>
</ul>
<p>And one thing I will <em>never</em> get used to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>People drive on the left side of the road</li>
</ul>
<p>I think my favourite little detail is the grocery stores. (Hey, I'm still too new here to buy all my food at markets.) In North America, all our products are plastered with big pictures, brand names, etc. Here, you can distinguish the peanut butter by a giant label that says <q>PEANUT BUTTER</q>. Cereal, tea, condiments: all have big labels saying what they are.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, there was a concert at Shoreline Ampitheatre (literally a 5-minute walk from work) with the Goo Goo Dolls and the Counting Crows. (I went only for the Crows, but honestly, who doesn't want to hear <i>Iris</i> played live, too?)</p>
<p>I had bought my ticket pretty much as soon as I got to California, at which point I didn't know anybody here, so I ended up sitting alone.</p>
<p>The opening band, <a href="http://www.augustanamusic.com/">Augustana</a>, was quite good. I tried to buy their CD but I couldn't find the stall where they were selling it.</p>

<p>The Goo Goo Dolls were great. The Counting Crows were even better.</p>

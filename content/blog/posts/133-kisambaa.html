<p>My website, for whatever ludicrous reason, comes up as the #1 Google Search result for <q>Kisambaa.</q></p>
<p>Since I am now considered the authoritative source on Kisambaa, I should explain a bit about it: it is the native language of the Sambaa people in Tanzania, who live east of Arusha and just across the border from Kenya. <q>How are you?</q> in the afternoon is <q>onga mshi,</q> and the correct response is <q>tiwedi</q>. I do not know the formalities for morning, nighttime, thanks, or farewells. In fact, I know practically nothing about Kisambaa.</p>
<p>I found a website called Ethnologue Report which <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ksb">says 664,000 Sambaa people exist</a>. I would take that website's information with a grain of salt, however: <a href="http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=swh">its entry on Swahili</a> suggests that Kiswahili only has 540,000 mother-tongue speakers, while in reality Zanzibar alone accounts for 1,000,000 Swahili people and I expect a significant subset of the younger population of Dar es Salaam (population 3,000,000) also speaks Kiswahili better than any other language.</p>

<p>Factoid: most native Kisambaa speakers know Kiswahili as a second language.</p>
<p>Factoid Number Two: Since I am writing English, I should really be writing <q>Sambaa</q> instead of <q>Kisambaa</q> (for the same reason I would write <q>French</q> instead of <q>Fran√ßais</q>); but if I had done that to begin with my website never would have been the #1 search result.</p>

<p>Today is International Women's Day. It is a public holiday in Uganda (and has been for the past ten or so years). The women here in Gulu are quite excited about it: yesterday they were running around town with brooms, <q>cleaning the town</q> in preparation for the big day. Today I will hopefully get a chance to spectate some of the celebrations.</p>
<p>I hesitate to comment on sexism in a public setting such as this, since I do not wish to offend some of my readers. Specific stories might single out my friends here.</p>
<p>Instead, I will admit with shame that since arriving in Uganda <em>I</em> have made some comments, in conversations with men, which objectify women. I have no adequate excuse: <q>peer pressure</q> is a cop-out, and there will <em>never</em> be a valid reason to treat people like objects. In celebration of International Women's Day, I promise that I will not make such comments in the future.</p>

<p>Sexism is not a joke. It is a <em>very</em> real problem facing the world today. And no, North America hasn't overcome it yet: not by a long shot.</p>
<p><b><i>Fun Fact</i></b>: According to Stephen Lewis, who recently completed his term as UN Special Envoy for AIDS in Africa, gender inequality is the most important cause of AIDS in Africa.</p>

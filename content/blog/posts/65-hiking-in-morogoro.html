<p><i>Challenge: like a trip up and down a mountain, make a crescendo and then a decrescendo in the number of words per paragraph.</i></p>
<p>Ten days ago, I hiked a mountain in Morogoro.</p>
<p>Three of us Swahili students took part in the hike, and we had one guide. We packed lunches and set out under cloudy conditions.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the village at the foot of the mountain, we were charged a fee (less than CAN$2). This is normal, and we knew about it beforehand.</p>
<p>The hike was surprisingly difficult: certainly harder than any hikes I have yet braved (including <a href="http://adamhooper.com/blog/Uganda/Sipi">Sipi in Uganda</a>). We did not undertake the highest hike (which would have brought us above the cloud layer), and after an hour we were certainly glad of that.</p>
<p>There were many villagers living on the mountainside. It was stunning to climb three hours from the nearest genuine village and still find houses. I could only wonder at how the residents can make a living. Having no expenses is a plus; but spraining an ankle or catching malaria must be simply awful.</p>

<p>We arrived at the pinnacle of our hike after four hours of steep, muddy climbing. We ate while absorbing a view of all of Morogoro and its surrounding mountains: absolutely spectacular, and certainly worth the effort. Some children who had followed us along the path (barefoot, on the steep, slippery mud) sat with us. (White people are certainly not a surprise in the budding tourism industry around Morogoro, but we are still uncommon. And when we fumble around with our improving Swahili, we become even more interesting.)</p>
<p>Our trip down was meant to pass an area called Morningside, where European missionary work dates back to German (pre-WW1) days. Unfortunately, our path was blocked at a bottleneck by a billy-goats-gruff-style villager who tried to extort the equivalent of CAN$5 from us. Our fee at the bottom had been paid, and we showed proof; but this man said he was being ripped off by the people at the bottom so he was taking matters into his own hands.</p>
<p>We backtracked. Our hard climb up the mud became an even harder climb down, but after a few tumbles we got through the worst of it. Our guide took us along a shortcut, and before we knew it we were walking through a part of Morogoro we had never seen. We turned a corner and—surprise—there was our convent.</p>

<p>Morogoro and its inhabitants are stunningly beautiful. I miss the place already.</p>

<p>It's been ages since I last posted; to correct this, I'll try to post all the blog entries I <em>didn't</em> post in the same order in which I <em>should</em> have posted them.</p>
<p>So, first off: a couple of weeks ago I got myself a new camera (Canon A540) at Circuit City. The salesman was a real Californian surfer dude. Luckily I had researched a bit beforehand; when I asked him the difference between the A540 and the A530, he said, <q>well, the A540 has more megapixels, which is like, better....</q> He gave the impression that he was agog at my throwing money around, which makes me wonder how long he's been working at a retail electronics store.</p>
<p>Best of all was during the checkout: a coworker of his was talking about a restaurant where she had been a few nights ago and she said it was really good. He asked, <q>is it <em>hella</em>-good?</q> The answer: <q>no, not <em>hella</em>-good, just really good.</q></p>

<p>So, here is a picture of my camera. The camera isn't <em>hella</em>-good, it's just really good:</p>

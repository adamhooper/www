This directory holds all sorts of random, small programs I have written.

It may be of use if you are curious about learning a new programming language.
Most examples are written in C, Java, and Python.

It can also serve me as a sort of portfolio. Keep in mind that most of the code
is several years old and I have learned a lot since I wrote it.

McGill Software Engineering

This directory contains my homework assignments from McGill University during
my undergrad in Software Engineering. On most of these assignments, I received
good grades. You may find some insight.

Do not plagiarize on homework assignments. Cheating is easy to detect. Changing
variable names, tabs, spacing, and so forth will not hide the source of the
programs herein. This code is valuable as a learning tool, not as completed
assignments.

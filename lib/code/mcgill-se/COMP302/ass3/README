Each file represents half of the answer to a question. The ".scm" files are
the Scheme files which answer the question; the ".test" files are copy/pasted
from an interactive Scheme session, testing the various features I've added.

The files have a simple naming scheme: "q<num>_<chapter>-<question>.scm" means
"The answer to question <num>, exercise <chapter>.<question>". I have commented
each file with exactly which changes I've made to the original interpreter, and
from where I copied the original interpreter (since there is a lot of copying
of code).

I've separated all procedure definitions into files named after the question
for which they are needed. I've also made *all-procedures.scm*, which is just a
concatenation of all ten .scm files, because the assignment asks for it all in
a single file. For the same reason, I have made *all-tests*, a concatenation of
all the tests.

Directory contents:

README: this file
all-procedures.scm: Scheme code for the entire assignment
all-tests: all tests (a copy-pasted interactive Scheme session)
q1.scm..q10.scm: individual answers to q1, q2, etc. (procedure definitions)
q1.test..q10.test: individual tests of q1, q2, etc. procedures
Makefile: I just used this to generate all-procedures.scm and all-tests

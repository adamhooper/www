a)

The grammar is ambiguous because "1 + 2 * 3" has two different leftmost
derivations. It can be derived like this:

<expr>
<expr> * <expr>
<expr> + <expr> * <expr>
1 + <expr> * <expr>
1 + 2 * <expr>
1 + 2 * 3

And like this:

<expr>
<expr> + <expr>
1 + <expr>
1 + <expr> * <expr>
1 + 2 * <expr>
1 + 2 * 3

b)

The second derivation corresponds to the proper mathematical order of
operations, i.e., "1 + (2 * 3)", while the first can be thought of as
"(1 + 2) * 3" since the "<expr> + <expr>" is substituted into the first
"<expr>" of "<expr> * <expr>" -- if parentheses were used, this could be
interpreted as "(<expr> + <expr>) * <expr>".

(To remove the ambiguity in the BNF, parentheses (or similar) would be needed.)

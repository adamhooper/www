We are asked to show that (Y f) = (f (Y f)) for any f in this function:

(define Y
  (lambda (f)
    ((lambda (x) (f (x x)))
      (lambda (x) (f (x x))))))

Applying Y to some function f, we compute (Y f) to be:

((lambda (x) (f (x x)))
  (lambda (x) (f (x x))))

And if we apply the first lambda function to the second -- that is, plug the
second into the body of the first (replacing the x's), we get:

(f
  ((lambda (x) (f (x x)))
    (lambda (x) (f (x x)))))

Look familiar? It's (f (Y f)) -- QED.

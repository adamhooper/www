There are tons of files included here, but they are named nicely.

The files which do *not* start with the letter "q" are auxiliary: they were
used by me, they may be required by the q files, but they don't answer any
questions in and of themselves.

The rest of the files are numbered as follows:

q#1_#2-#3[-#4].(scm|test)

Where:

#1 is the question number from the assignment
#2 is the chapter
#3 is the exercise number in that chapter
#4 is the part of that exercise, if the exercise is divided into parts. In
   Chapter 5 we deal with four implementations -- these are numbered 1 to 4
"scm" files contain code, and "test" files contain tests.

Note that Exercise 5.5 only deals with code and 5.6 only deals with a test.

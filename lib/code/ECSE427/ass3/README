There's not much to say about this assignment. It was very straightforward.

One thing annoyed me. I made a totally generic, thread-safe queue implementation
and then had to go make it ugly because our assignment needs to print out the
buffer number. That should explain the need for QueueEntry.

Since the queue is separate from the rest of the program, there's no way to
print the message "client sleeps", since the queue implementation does not
print anything. Judging by the sample trace on the ECSE427 website, though, this
is not a problem.

What else to say? Run "make" to generate "print". Run "print" without arguments
and it'll print what you need to type. On mimi.cs.mcgill.ca it compiles with
warnings, but those warnings are in system libraries and are outside my control.

The priority system used in YAUThreads is simple:

- Each thread is spawned using YAUSpawnPriority(threadfunc, priority). priority
  is a positive integer greater than 0. YAUSpawn() creates thread with the
  default priority of 1.
- When startYAUThreads(PRIORITY) is called, the threads are sorted so that
  higher-priority threads will be scheduled before lower-priority threads.
- The scheduler proceeds in round-robin fashion, but allocates more time to
  higher-priority threads. The amount of time allocated is proportional to the
  thread's priority.

This simple system prevents starvation since every thread gets processor time
every cycle. And higher-priority threads get more CPU time.

Simple, yet effective!

<h1>Circuit Simulator Applet</h1>

<p>
 <object title="Circuit Simulator Applet" codetype="application/java"
         classid="java:CircuitSimulatorApplet.class" width="600" height="450">
  Either the applet was not found on the web server or your browser will not
  run Java byte code.
 </object>
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: Due to time and sanity constraints, this applet complies
   with the question's requirements but goes no farther in terms of
   user-friendliness. Any questions are probably addressed in this
   badly-organized documentation.</p>
<h3>Basic Premise</h3>
<p>The entire applet runs on a canvas, where any object can be dragged wherever
   you want it to be. Even the buttons which start at the lower-right are
   draggable.</p>
<p>To use the simulator, just add some nodes and gates, use wires to connect
   them, and click on nodes to change their signals. Nodes and wires with
   signals are blue; without signals, they're black.</p>
<h3>Nodes?</h3>
<p>Nodes are the basic building block of the circuit. For the most part you can
   think of them as a big ball of conductiveness, except they have defined
   inputs and outputs. Nodes can have an arbitrary number of input and output
   wires, but you'll want to use just one input.</p>
<p>It's easy to add a node to the circuit diagram:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Click on <samp>Create new Node</samp>. The node will appear in the
     upper-left part of the circuit diagram.</li>
 <li>Drag the node to the desired location.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Gates</h3>
<p>Gates are bunches of nodes which behave differently. They have an explicitly
   defined number of inputs and outputs and they take time to change values. If
   an OR gate has a signal going into it, the output is guaranteed to have a
   signal exactly 5 seconds later -- even if the signal is cut off 4 seconds
   before that time (in which case, 6 seconds after the start of this
   badly-explained paragraph it will <em>not</em> have a signal).</p>
<p>To add a gate, use the same procedure as with nodes, but use their
   corresponding buttons.</p>
<h3>Wires</h3>
<p>Wires connect nodes. Adding a wire is a 3-click operation:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Click on <samp>Add new Wire</samp>.</li>
 <li>Click on the node which will be feeding the wire its signal.</li>
 <li>Click on the node which will be receiving the wire's signal.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note</em>: Wires will <em>only</em> connect to nodes. Luckily, gates are
   composed of bunches of nodes. AND and OR gates have two nodes on the left
   half of the gate and one on the right. Inverter gates have one node on the
   left and one on the right. If you're not sure you clicked on the first node
   properly, just click on it again.</p>
<p>Also of note: Nodes can have multiple outputs. They can also have multiple
   inputs, but this makes less sense: its outputs will be set to the OR value
   of the inputs (real-world circuits do not distinguish between input and
   output, but this is <em>my</em> world, and in my world they do).</p>
<h3>Putting it all together...</h3>
<p>You've put together a beautiful circuit. Took a while, eh? Glad to see you
   got through it (if not, read on...). To see the circuit in action, just
   click on a node to toggle its output value. The rest of the circuit will
   come alive as the gates fire. Try using a feedback loop: you can get the kind
   of blinking that was previously only available on really annoying Christmas
   lights.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>You mean, it <em>didn't</em> work perfectly? I'm not surprised. My eyes are
   so tired that I'm typing without even looking at my screen right now: I doubt
   I've actually caught all my bugs.</p>
<p>Even if I did, I know I'm missing a very important feature: deletion. Yes,
   that's right, you can't delete circuit components. Don't look for the hidden
   features anywhere, they're just not there. I'm just refusing to code more
   Java before the deadline. And there's the moral of the story: Deadlines
   produce lower-quality code.</p>
<p>Also, wires only send signals one way. This was in the question, though, so
   I think it's all right. If a wire's not turning blue, it might be backwards.
   I imagine adding a second wire in the proper direction would solve the
   dilemma. Or it would crash the applet. We were never asked for a
   <em>reliable</em> applet....</p>
<h3>The Code</h3>
<p>The UI doesn't do that great a job of separating the user from the
   programming concepts used. So if you've used the applet you probably have
   a good idea of how it works. If not, the code's very heavily commented, so
   it shouldn't be that hard to understand.</p>
<p>Evil hacks are clearly marked. Beware, ye who ventures near them.</p>
<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>In the course of this project, I learned more about programming with Swing
   and AWT in particular than I did about programming GUIs in general,
   unfortunately. I realize that my final result is a mess, but it's really just
   a matter of two or three critical bugs (and a couple of FIXMEs in the code)
   which I never had the time to fix.</p>
<p>I also rediscovered what I've known for a while, that GUIs are a pain in the
   neck. Unfortunately, that applies especially to canvas-like GUIs. I hate
   every one I've ever encountered, and mine certianly does nothing to change my
   feelings about them. I believe they simply cannot be as intuitive as normal
   user interfaces. However, I don't know how to implement circuit diagrams with
   a normal user interface. So it follows quite logically that I believe this
   program could not possibly be as intuitive as, say, a well-designed web page.
   </p>
<p>Speaking of bad UIs... it takes <em>forever</em> to upload all these files
   to WebCT!</p>
